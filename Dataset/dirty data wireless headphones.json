"Closed Captions": " this episodes sponsored by Wix so these things theyve been requested by a large number of you on Twitter in the YouTube comments you guys know I really enjoy looking at headphones its not very often that you get a completely new form factor in the headphone territory in the headphone segment we have earbuds we have over ear headphones we have on ear headphones of course with a headband associated we have the full wireless stuff of course the very popular ear pods now air pod anyhow here we end up on this a completely new take its called human headphones and when you wear it thats what it looks like its crazy how is it on there how does it stay put thats whats happening right here shes wearing it hes wearing it for this to work out its gonna have to deliver sound quality above what the earbud is capable of big big sound fullsize speaker drivers so doesnt I say look were not trying to be as portable as the earbud but were gonna give you the sound quality listen out loud put them together to activate a powerful Bluetooth speaker okay so they also become a Bluetooth speaker so now you got a portable speaker as well which is on you at all times okay use your voice to make calls send text and translate to 13 different languages builtin translator you could use that Jack on your travel cant believe highly requested from you individuals out there in the world look at that thats the thing thats the package its so interesting oh my good its like a little capsule how do I even oh you just pull it apart look at that theyre on and ready to pair I guess when I peel this off theyre just in pairing mode thats crazy simple oh thats some memory foam action you see how that stays sitting down for a second if I guess this is four but each individual is gonna be a bit different from that stand point so that moves around like that I see microphones on the outside how does this go lets find out oh okay so your is fitting in there uh I should say Im already having a very visitor experience well first of all I look crazy theyre saying ready to pair but they also went into a passthrough mode so right now I have crystalclear audio like you guys myself my own voice and you guys theyre almost like hearing aids right now talk jack oh my god here we go lets get the human app theres this install thing that I definitely should have paid attention to pull the hook that goes around what theyre calling the ear root you know you had an ear roof no you did it I feel like this guy with the slightly longer hair it blends for him whether Im wearing a hat or no hat that is you are gonna see that and this is your charge cable this is definitely proprietary its a nice little dock and its USB see on the other end a nice simple power brick to go with it fit attachment pads okay so these are also a memory foam so you have options there these are magnetic fit  theres a really lot of magnetic stuff going on and then look at the travel pouch jack thats kind of nice isnt it feels like a suede sort of finish theres a silica gel inside Im not gonna throw it jack it just wouldnt be very nice look how happy she is you see thats what happens you buy these thats what happens I trust I trust lets go pair it up okay so this is nice this is just as easy as pulling them apart they turn on and connect to the last pair device thats it I love that I like that that type of interface you dont even need to think about you just close them down thats it can I just say these are expensive I feel like youre feeling that right now I feel you probably feel that as you saw the package come out what are we looking at pricewise Willie do something theyve got a price to him dont they 260 dollars he says anything he was amplified when he said that because I heard its a hefty price tag it might be the future though so lets lets think about all right touch controls tap to pause media playback tap again to resume swipe forward to go forward so I back to the back swipe up tank respawn its a typical touchpad its a common interface now press and hold either headphone to amplify outside sound if I was playing music they would shut off to isolate me a little bit but then I would just tap over here I just be like okay lets continue the conversation Im just tapping my module oh now youre shut off now Im muffled now its terrible and now youre back its night and day blend mode so tapping the blend button in the app will toggle outside sound amplification for greater ambient awareness and this now has become like a feature we expect in highend headphones we want this we need this tapping the speaker button on your app allows you to transform your headphones into a portable speaker its a nice little touch I mean the teenagers in the cafeteria well they might have a cool product here lets leave it in blend mode and well go find some tunes thats step one were gonna listen to some music can I do 60 soul is that alright with you Ill get there theyre way better than your buds fine they sound way better than air pods like way better than air pods its a bigger speaker right I like you know I like technology you know every so often yeah I just sit over here this and not and then this comes along and Im like yeah headphones theyre not done yet either nothings done yet everything can be improved almost everything could be rethought we cant think of this differently and Im having a different experience right now let me just okay so other gestures volume yeah volume okay that works lets go next nice track oh I dont know guys Im feeling some Im having him Im having something happen here Im tingling it might be Sam Cooke I dont know it might be the fact that I feel unencumbered by any devices like I feel feel like I could bob and weave low time coming but I know I dont know that theyre gonna be for everyone for me this is not bothersome at all I do feel them on top of the ear it could they be even more invisible could they be even lighter maybe is it the hybrid they were aiming at I think it is we got around the world remember that song that is some old school thats thick thats hit it sounds good man its got bass to it I mean theres bass there oh we got a due speaker mode real quick class headphones together to enable speaker okay boom speaker suite what thats it they know that theyre in speaker mode you cant do that to me you cant do that to me the smartphone speaker is just as good as that it doesnt sound that good thats kind of weird I think that was one of those bonus elements where they just wanted to be like Annie can do to make it difficult for me and my company to continue to do business the way that Im doing it I have to start to look at alternative track it sounds like a smart phone speaker guys thats not why youre buying this that shouldnt be why youre buying this dont expect youre getting like legit Bluetooth speaker performance out of it its just you could use it like that in a pinch the translator I dont know how many people are gonna be buying this for that purpose anyway here were gonna showcase were gonna see if its right or not here English to Spanish hello Im hungry Id like to find a restaurant most importantly Im looking for a grilled cheese sandwich Music Im hearing Spanish in my ear right now Im breanne totake gustara hungry youd like it French to English just suis fatigu eh yeah I am tired so that could be cool it works is this product the future of all headphones I dont know not immediately it takes time its expensive its different and how many people are gonna take a chance on something thats this different youll probably be surprised at the audio performs youll probably be surprised at what theyre capable of delivering at this form factor of course its not all rosy this goes over the ear Im noticing right now for example my ears they heat it up a bit because theyre completely covered right when you have these on that does not happen with an earbud air pod and so forth from non sample I think it will find an audience but its gonna take time to replace the more standard headphone earbud models from a charging perspective that is crazy simple as far as were concerned youre not fiddling around with any connectors which can be a headache it feels futuristic because of all the magnets in play and the smoothness of it itll go on there either way theres some cool people at this company even if its just from a design perspective its a lot of thought that has to go into a product like this a lot of drawings I mean I appreciate the work for a form factor thats so unusual and I have to say of course its only been one session at this point but Im impressed so far this is a cool thing so my dog Otis just had puppies and I want to show you guys how

youve known that this is the way that they felt for a decade or more the technology is just starting to catch up and Apple is doing a little bit to sort of aid and accelerate that process one of the examples of that is the new air pods Apples air pods come in a small case like this which acts as a charging device there to bluetooth headphones separately not attached by a cord which is to tradition for wireless Bluetooth headset the air pod case acts as the charger it charges itself via lightning port it has a small pairing button on the back which you use just for initial pairing or you can use to pair to non Apple devices or non iPhone 7 devices so if youd like to use it with an old iPhone or with an Android phone you absolutely can they act as regular bluetooth headsets and are paired the normal way but they do have a special pairing method just for iPhones which is pretty slick you flick open the lid there are two headphones inside nestled in here and youre charging you see the small green light here allows you to see whether theyre fully charged or not you can remove them one at a time out of their casing if we look down inside the casing theres small metal contacts those contacts come into contact with the bottom of the headphone here and that actually allows each headphone to act as an antenna for the case for the initial pairing and repairing procedures theres a small audio signal that tells you hey its in your ear Im ready to go and then from that point on youre just listening to whatever is currently playing on your phone youre able to activate things on your phone by double tapping either one of your buds youll hear an audio tone and Syria will activate on the device you can then ask Siri to do anything you can normally ask Siri to do when you remove the air pod from your ear the playback will auto pause and thats thanks to two small sensors that touch your ear on the front and back here once you remove one you can still begin playback with your other one and do anything you normally would with just one ear button so how do they work thats question the answer is pretty damn good the Bluetooth connection because it is a bluetooth LE connection when its all said and done its strong 4550 feet open field its a little bit longer between walls Ive experienced about thirty five feet you know would and standard walls in the home at this point Id have to say that every part of the experience from the accelerometers that detect touch to the auto pause to the pairing the case and of course the design as long as your ear accommodates them is far superior to any other Bluetooth headset that Ive used but that being said the audio quality is about on par its not incredibly stellar although they are very loud much louder than a standard set of earbuds if I had one major complaint its that the accelerometers are really only used for one gesture the DoubleTap which can be used to hang up phone call or to initiate commands via Siri of course auto pause happens when you take them out I really wish that there was a single or triple tap to move forward and back in tracks or some sort of automatic gesture to increase or decrease volume because as of now all of that has to happen through Siri so for volume up double tap Siri please raise the volume its a little bit heavy of an interaction for an earbud in coming years I feel that Apple will focus more and more on audio as a platform so if you have one of these in your ear at all times and youre able to access any of your information that you have on your phone on your Apple watch on an iPad or even on your Mac at home how much more accessible how much more interesting with the applications being for that so I feel that Apples building that audio platform out there Ill expand on it with more and cheaper wireless headphones I wouldnt be surprised that these be with the phone in two years and they will allow developers to build applications and even companies on top of the principle that if you have a continuous twoway audio connection with your user what things are possible and that is where Apples going with this you", "video_title": "Apple AirPods wireless

boy floss back again with another video and today were gonna take a look at my top 10 truly wireless earphones now all of these you could get from Amazon Ill throw the links up in the description the prices range from 70 to 180 bucks so everything that youre gonna see in this video less than 200 bucks now on the side note these arent the top 10 earphones on the planet these are just the top 10 that I have now other companies make these like JBL Ill check Lanson be an oh and a few other ones if you dont see the ones that you had your eye on in this video hit me up in the comments and well check those out later now theres two sets of earphones that youre not gonna see in this video number one the braggy  now as much as I like these theres one thing about them that I dont like and thats the price for the originals youre still looking at 250 bucks and for the braggy  Pro youre looking at 300 bucks now in this day and age that price is to get damn high now if it was a couple of years ago I wouldnt be complaining because you only had two choices you had the original samsung icons and you had the braggy  and both of them was over 200 bucks it is what it is fastforward to today pretty much every company makes a set and they all range between 100 and 200 bucks suspended more than 200 thats a note for me dog and the second set that youre not gonna see in this video are these the Qi Cs and everything that looks like these youve seen these on Amazon a dime a dozen I think I paid 30 bucks for these dont wish them money the sound quality is trash and the Bluetooth connectivity is garbage I all these 30 ones pass on alright so lets get right into it now Im gonna start off with the most requested ones on my channel now theres no particular order Im just a matter of fact let me tell you what Im gonna do Im just gonna go through all the ones that I have and then Ill rank them on sound quality feel and look but once I show you them we just talk about the price

youre wearing them pretty  silly but some people like them silly but some people like them some people dont these really aint my cup of tea now what I use these for the most is talking on the phone

little poison for the trolls file let  lets see microUSB charging cable you got some different wings I always big to small and thats pretty much it now for the charging case lets see yeah the charging case is a little bit on the big side what were gonna work with that and here goes your earbuds all right so let me pair these up and well see how Desalle all right John still be back in now it was a little bit worried about these because the air phones are kind of big and the case is kind of big but let me tell you this the sound quality on these is almost mindblowing alright so far these are the best the base is intense the sound is crystalclear and these might be the loudest ones I heard yet so for sound these are eight plus now for the field like I said theyre a little bit big but once you get these in your ear theyre not gonna move around you could definitely work out with these theyre gonna stay in place and for the look this is what theyre gonna look like when youre rocking them a little bit on the big side but not OD but Ill sacrifice that exercise for the sound the sound oh nice oh my god all right now Im trying not to be a height beast but it is what it is lets throw them in

download the same Sony app that you use with all the Sony headphones you got two ambient sound controls these new feature noise cancellation but noise cancellation its cool not as good as the overtheair Sony headphones but it does cancel out a little bit of noise you got to EQ so you got speech bright excited mellow relaxed vocal treble boots and of course bass boost now when you activate the bass boost youre gonna be blown away trust me as far as the field I was a little bit concerned because they do look kind of long I didnt think I was gonna stay at my ears correctly but you could

"NiWqsZesm_E", "Closed Captions": " so I made that video recently about the Apple earpods they came back into my life Ive been using the air pods and kind of enjoying it theyre wildly successful you see them out in the world other manufacturers you know theyre entering the space this is the latest incarnation of the fully wireless Samsung earbud product has a couple of features that havent been seen before prime my favorite one is the fact that this entire setup can charge from any phone that supports wireless charge sharing because this is a Samsung product and this is a Samsung phone theres also some interplay there thats a bit smoother than it might otherwise be with a thirdparty pair of earbuds or puds but once youre into the app this is where I think they have a bit of an advantage over the air pods theyre super configurable here we can see the battery life of each individual units you can use one independently of the other you can keep one of these guys charging in the case while listening to the other one theres some different equalizer settings here for a bass boost soft dynamic clear and so on you can manage how these things deal with notifications they do have touch pads on the side unlike the air pods these have interchangeable ear tips and ear hooks as well look at all those options the air pod youve seen it before doesnt fit that far into the ear canal for some people this fits really well others it wont stay in their ears these on the other hand are gonna be a bit more predictable because they sit further in the ear canal and they have that secondary rubber plasticky component they should just be a bit more secure in there considering the way that theyre designed air pod is a bit taller but also slightly less chunky than the Galaxy bud so people want to know hey which one should I get considering that you can use either on multiple platforms they do work as Bluetooth headsets you can use the air pods on Android you could use the Galaxy buds on iOS within the app theres also a find my earbuds button so thatll track these down these things could be pretty easy to lose I mean they are tiny also theres a pretty cool ambient sound option I can actually elevate the volume of ambient sound a sound around me so itll be amplified into my ear so I can hear my surroundings while Im listening to music podcast audiobook and so on now you can toggle that all the way down so that its muted you know whats going on around me is muted you have ambient if youre on the bike youre cycling you need to hear if if a car honks its horn or something this can really amplify your surroundings of course its not on the air pods theres also a voice focus feature in there so this looks for voices specifically and allows them to cut through that particular frequency range I find this to be useful from time to time now the way that the touchpad works you can tap to play or pause a track double tap to play the next track answer or end a phone call triple tap to play the previous track and touch and hold to use a user configurable users choice you could have that launched something specifically do something specifically and thats user configurable thats nice now that I have it for quick ambient sound Im gonna touch and hold and see if I can lighten up the surroundings here we go oh wow thats cool it toggles ambient mode while youre holding your finger on the touch pad Im in ambient right now I can totally hear my conversation hear my own voice now do I look a little strange doing this quite possibly but the question you all have is like how do they stack up against the air pods now as you guys know Im an s10 user this is the device thats currently in my pocket so the effectiveness of either of these earbuds it has to be in correlation to this particular device we talked about some advantages within the app who knows I might be willing to give up those extra features in exchange for potentially better sound Im not really sure well start with the galaxy buds I want to make sure Ive got maximum volume okay so now I know Ive got max volume a little sample mmhmm okay now were in soft right now dynamic clear bass hmm Music okay Im wondering right now if the people that have tested these already had them in full volume or not cuz I read some of those things that you read and that was the experience I was having until I made sure the buds themselves were max volume and the phone was max volume now theres a lot more thump way more bass our people doing it wrong Music its a headphone Im hearing instruments I was gone for a minute did you trick sort of Ive heard better kind of feel like I got to do this exact same track right now on the air pods like right now without further ado hurry up hurry up hurry up way less isolation I hear the the fan on the camera here we go beginning you know neither are blowing my brains out you know obviously Ive tried some very expensive headphones in this spot in this seat right here weve done it together you and I Jack Kirk and whoever else happens to be behind me on any given day these are tiny dental floss situations look at them in terms of sound I think I can say based on that quick little test right there the buds theres a bit more thump to it maybe my expectations were too high either probably closer to this performance then they are to like a fullon pair of headphone performance that said the most striking difference for me between the two is the fit and the feel right in the sound seal when you put these on you feel isolated but theres a drawback to that I noticed theyre in my ears a little bit more this I dont even feel it this is a kind of a tighter feel if I had to choose this is a bit more comfortable for my particular ear canal and thats part of the reason I think I keep reaching for the air pods in the first place not because they sound the best but because you just dont even notice youre wearing them that could be a good thing or a bad thing neither are going to be an amazing audio experience but really these products are about convenience so evaluating them on convenience you have to give certain points to the new Samsung product because of the fact that it can charge wirelessly and off of the phone itself also the app gives you more configurability also another thing worth noting the galaxy buds are a bit cheaper than the air pods though thats not much of a surprise that is a hard pick I really dont know I mean it might be so simple as if youre on on samsung or on Android you might go for these and if youre on iOS youll probably go for these just for the easier pairing across devices oh its a hard decision Id say if Im about to do some kind of physical activity if Im going for a jog or something I dont jog but like lets say I did I will probably reach for these ones its just a bit more confidence in the fit but if its just if its in an environment like around the house I she really liked the idea of not feeling the thing in your ear as stupid as that looks you forget that its there I already have so many great sounding headphones if I want to get down to business with music I think Ill probably still reach for these more because of that factor and then also keep by Sony headphones the dedicated over ear headphones with the noise cancellation everything else keep those for the discerning listening but if I didnt have those other headphones and I needed something that could isolate better than the air pods and I can only have one pair I only had 130 bucks for one pair I probably go for these its only a one pair of headphones I probably would choose these over these but in conjunction with a really nice pair that you use sometimes this is the I dont even notice Im wearing them headset thats the bottom line Music", "video_title": "Samsung Galaxy Buds VS Apple AirPods", "video_comment_count": "119050", "video_dislike_count": "34970", "video_view_count": "5897112", "video_category": "28",

Captions": " One thing I havent posted on this channel for a long time is the video about Beats headphones They have recently been acquired by Apple and have undergone a lot of changes thats why this video But the premise is that they are not cheap so only a few people have In other words Beats Solo3 Wireless is the first headset that can be paired with Apple Of course we will test Behind the earphone box you can see the wireless bluetooth the battery can last up to 40 hours Charge for 5 minutes play for 3 hours I think the battery capacity is very good Limited edition special color rose gold look here Very heavy factory smell inside Very exquisite carryon bag When I was a kid my nickname was actually a very good small tote Beans Now let us return to the discussion section Say hello to Beans and see how many comments you can get below Hi in German Beans Then there is a charging cable you may need it Except for Iphone I like to use it on airplanes Of course you know that the service system on the plane cannot use Bluetooth You can use the cable to connect your phone Dont bring any very cheap earphones on the plane because they will interfere with the signal Its not bad to buy a medium size In any case I still have to maintain the title of the strongest out of the box in my world The factory smell is more than average look at the words in rose gold and rose gold This streamlined headset is very popular now Support wireless connection you can also adjust your headset according to the size of your head  Oh See here there is a play button this hole is when you use the cable to connect This one is smaller than my girlfriends There is a Micro USB for charging and there is a row of lights to show your battery level Let me show you my headset is now fully charged and then this guy starts to shine Assuming it is ready to pair with the phone so look here Wow my goodness I didnt do anything at all I just unlocked and automatically connected After using the fingerprint to unlock it will jump out of the battery capacity full charge Im connected Here is a little common sense when you are using the same icloud account is All your Apple products will automatically connect to the headset Its like a laptop iPad Apple Watch just like your happy family Lets test how his voice is do we have music listening software here Come on Lew come see you together and see that my robocop is still here I dont know how to translate this passage I have already told you that Total Recall Terminator Bloodsport Van Damme are on the same day I dont know how to translate this passage DAHH I need to tell you something about beats Super popular then you let us people on the Internet we all like There is another kind of earphone in this world The one you have never heard before is Senheiser which is very good value for money And various other German names Hahaha The technical staff had to calm down a little bit Because what you are doing is you put yourself in a silo and you are Isolate yourself from the rest of the world The rest of the world is as complicated as the rest of life Marketing that feels like reality has some such recognition Whole package Dont go to the woman holding the Gucci bag and snatch it away You should bring an ecofriendly bag This is a package transaction in fact you are only paying for the headset advertising They give a lot of money for celebrities to wear and show up in front of the flashlight so that you have that kind of celebritys idea that you can buy it just like LEBRON JAMES Just bring the earphones for a whole year and you pay him for the whole year This is very important it will affect my feeling maybe my coffee is extra strengthen OKAY I think this product the Beats brand is not as good as people think Its not like people think if you know what Im talking about So bad emphasis is on the low end They are expensive I will agree with you The ease of connection will make sense to people Valuable to people they are the one harassing the person wearing rose gold Enjoy yourself like you can get lost in his role Rose Gold Solo Translation Xueyu Malaysia Okay please dont disturb me getting along

"cRNqVGfy2O4", "Closed Captions": " its time for a little bit of a showdown whats happening in noise canceling wireless noise canceling thats thats what people are upgrading to this what humans want to know about block out the ambience you could sewnin you could do your stuff these two guys right here then the conversation was centered around these two models and so I thought man these are the ones that have to go head to head right now the WH 1000x m3 and we also have the quiet comfort 35 to when it comes to noise cancelling most peoples first experience with it is likely through a Bose QuietComfort product but sony has a legit challenger here in the form of the m3 I have to get to the bottom of this rated at 30 hours of battery life with noise cancelling turned on compared to 20 on the Bose product that said the Bose product is a bit lighter they quit charge now which is one of the reasons to upgrade if you have an old set so in the case of the Sony here you can turn a 10 minute charge into five hours of listening time that was one of the major drawbacks to wireless headphones in the past less so now with these really short charge times and they also support voice assistance Google assistant is builtin to both of them will can I get a price update this should be close the QC 35 s right now through the link down below theyre probably 300 bucks while youre watching this the m3 is on the other hand are a little bit more expensive around 350 some paperwork and then everything else is in this carrying case user manual up top get the app turn on your headphones and everything else is in this carrying case holy smokes the travel size is actually quite similar a mesh and threaded kind of design this one is like a faux leather and then a medial Prine pocket so like theyre really and then a loop here and a loop here they go on head to head ladies and gentlemen padded Alcantara headband little pouch on this side there is a cable included as well both of these headphones can work in a wired fashion 25 millimeters on the part that connects to the headphone three point five millimeters on a part that connects to the audio source so type C is available on the Sonys but its micro USB with quick charge on the Bose interesting the thing youre going to notice about the Bose there are tactile buttons physical buttons volume up and down a dedicated assistant button theyre using a new more robust material apparently so they should hold up to wear and hair slightly better I like how this is not a button but a switch and when you turn this on it will immediately go into bluetooth pairing mode okay theres the Sonys the cable in this case a little more robust both threepointfive replacing this cable gonna be a bit easier than this one big fan of type C Im gonna give that advantage to the Sony side the airline adapter this is a little bit uncommon these days theyre usually on the plane if you need one unboxing experience and accessories may have to give it to the Sonys you know what that doesnt actually feel as heavy as I expected getting the difference in numbers on paper it still feels very lightweight you dont have a ton of buttons or switches here you can see you have the NFC logo there theres a dedicated power button but its very similar to the ambient or noise cancelling switch though I do like having a dedicated switch this will quickly give you access to ambient noise if you mean to hear it typec connector over here and also an LED light thats a nice little touch this is actually touch controlled volume controls play pause you can answer a phone call and you can also skip tracks forward and back you can also hold your palm over top of the ear cup which will then mute the sound of your music and allow you to hear an individual whos talking to you so you can quickly you know you walk up to the Starbucks you order a drink you quickly hold your hand over it its nice its better than having to take the ear cup off that is comfortable it is light without having them turned on and having the noise canceling function enabled theyre still cutting out a lot of the ambient noise one thing I look for with headphones is like how much are they squeezing me in order to achieve that this is not too much of a squeeze I feel like I could wear these for hours and hours huh passively these are not blocking as much theyre comfortable the head bed is slightly less wide a slight bit more pressure from it just Comfort not even listening to them Im probably gonna give it to the Bose right now these ones come off and fold like this so when you pick them up out of the case you go like this the Sonys fold the other way like this kind of gotta fold them and then turn them see what Im saying maybe theres a reason for that but its worth noting turn these guys on will do the Bos first easy setup I turn these on and ask me to pair right away drag to connect ah this is in reference to the voice assistant which it looks like is accessed via this button on the side here oh wow noise canceling full effect now okay so when you hit the button it tells you the time tells you if you have any notification it says you dont have any new notifications now if you did it would read them to you you dont have to go reach for your phone whats the population of Toronto fast they said 27 million you hold it and the cool thing that it does when youre talking to assistant is it lets you hear your own voice so the microphones on the outside are picking up your voice so theres a few different settings here for noise cancellation its in the high mode right now I cant hear anything right now while Im talking to you okay so lets go ahead and play some music now hmm Jack you know this track its a classic look at that make some noise Curt let me see if I can hear you man thats a track though noise cancelling is just crushing right now its destroying the world right now its incredible Kirk was talking over there turn attract forget it I didnt hear anything its just lips moving sound Im not gonna talk about it yet give me a second here okay now lets get the Sony app and lets do a quick compare oh wow Google assistant figured it out right away tap to connect well done so the integration here with assistant is bananas I didnt even need to get the app I mean I will also a hundred percent battery out of the box jaci out of you a couple points give him a couple points for that alright woah Wow okay so heres their app adaptive sound control noise cancelling oh my god that is crazy okay so it gives you control over ambience based on your circumstance and they give you these images in order to distinguish like what the activity might be appearancewise guys these these dont look as good right jack is actually giving the looks to these I thought because they were a bit bigger you might not like the look as much but you dont really notice that these two we got two votes here for these Wilkin and you saw the bows which appearance do you like better okay wow thats three votes for these on appearance the configurability is extreme I can go in here and toggle the amount of ambient sound I come here I couldnt do that over here if youre the type that likes to use these on public transit you know they announce the different stops and whatnot if you have the ambient sound control on its blocking out some stuff but letting some stuff in oh my god the noise cancelling comes on full blast say something Kirk Oh interesting I can hear you the adaptive sound control it knows that Im staying Wow so it knows Im not moving right now its got it mostly noise cancelling thats pretty smart look at this it has optimized based on little details including atmospheric pressure the sound position control what well I can change the sound stage theres a surround virtualizer theres an equalizer this is a much more comprehensive app from a personalization configuration standpoint oh baby if I just cover this ear cup its full feed microphones through to my head oh my god and its instant as well whoo we may have some contenders yeah I mean you listen to music yet this quiets the music but I can have a conversation and we still Phil Collins beneath it barely there and then and then its like this hes back hes back hold on were not were not talking yet hold on hold on hold on all right look I mean maybe you could tell from my reaction maybe not I feel like hes a step up on a sound quality holy moley thats a crush factory right there at the base like if you want it blow your head right clean off quick point from Jack he says these are more sealed less sound bleed substantially I mean having the equalizer builtin lets you really tune the sound performance of these as well and just all the other various configurability attributes in the app for the Sonys is pretty wild pair that with the fact that the way you interact with it with a double tap or the palm over top of the ear cup to have a quick conversation the ambient mode its a wild package a one thing I like about the Bose is the slightly smaller ear cup this is a really tough choice these do not sound bad were talking about a marginal kind of thing going on here and you may or may not hear that as much as I do its obvious to me that these are the better sounding headphones of the two I think the noise cancelling here performs a little bit better at maximum capacity you cant really go wrong with either of these but if Im out there and I got 300 or 350 bucks this is where Im going now you can let me know down in the comments which one would you take of these two if it was your choice either one of these will do but you want my pick go this way Music", "video_title": "The Best Noise Cancelling Headphones Bose or

"video_id": "JVkU5aqerH4", "Closed Captions": " powerbeats Pro its a big day you know that battery life sports LeBron James are you gonna recommend these over air pods are these better than air pods yes or no what yeah all right its been a long time actually since I looked at a pair of beats this is the latest from the beats brand of course now in the Apple family and because it had some benefits to this particular product it actually behaves a lot like ear pods I do have some air pods here these are the black ones from a recent video these are done up by color where no you cant get them in black but it kind of makes sense for this comparison since the power beats Pro are in black these are gonna be a little bit more expensive than Apples air pods and they have a slightly different design I think this will be popular for athletes people who want to have the ear hook on there have a bit more of a secure fit battery up to nine hours of Wireless play 24 hours with the charging case sweat and waterresistant adjustable secure fit and on ear controls one thing I like before I even pop this open they put the controls on both earbuds so you can trigger play pause from either side whichever is right for you so you dont need to remember was that button on the left or on the right now of course with the Beats products pretty much all of them the expectation is kind of premium price point like its 250 bucks so keep that in mind the case is bigger its quite a bit bigger than air pods its way bigger its like six of these air pots five maybe you pull out the earbud it fits over the ear like this and you have interchangeable ear tips as well this has become the standard for athletic style earphones and for good reason you want something lightweight you want something secure and you dont want something huge and you want something sweat resistant well this has all those components and attributes so I think eventually youre gonna see a lot of these things at the gym youre gonna see a lot of these things on the basketball court this is the wireless charge case theres two contact points on the inside theres also a button on the inside yes its a pairing button of course if you have an iPhone when you pop this open its gonna its gonna register to pair immediately or at least is gonna ask you to register to pair because this product is using the h1 chip so to pair it youre just gonna pop this open dont remove the earbuds and then itll prompt you on your device if you do have an Android device these will work as well youre just gonna need to press and hold the pairing button and then pair it like you would any other Bluetooth device so yes even though beads is part of the Apple brand this will work with Android devices and various other Bluetooth devices now the port on the back its not USB typec so staying true to the Apple branding like the air pods this is actually a lightning connector a black USB cable to charge it up a lightning connector there so kind of unfortunate if you have a lot of USB typec components this has I phone users first their front of mine and it makes sense because these power beats Pro theyre gonna be sold in Apple stores are gonna be theyre gonna move a lot of Units on Apples website so theyre gonna take care of iPhone users first five minute charge equals 15 hours of play heres a different ear tip options this is important especially for 250 pair of headphones you kind of have to have this you should have this its gonna be in the ear canal its gonna fit a bit deeper than the then the air pod does usually what that means is you youre gonna have better bass reproduction because you get a better seal in the ear canal that you just cant achieve with the air pod but it will also mean that you know putting this thing on and taking it off its a bit more of a headache its not quite as smooth so just keep that in mind as well but that looks like the standard medium connector theyve also included this twostage adapter if you look at that just before I try these things out I think its kind of important to address the size I think some people are gonna think thats a big container so air pods tiny little dental floss situation that is obviously its nothing you dont even notice it its got a barely there kind of situation if you try to do that with the power beats the latest power beats Pro whats gonna happen I mean youre gonna see it but its doable its not terrible actually its heavier youre not gonna want it there all day headphones over here phone ready to go it open and look at this this is really the benefit of this cohesiveness if youre an iPhone user youre really gonna appreciate this and hows the install lets go ahead and try oh I got a little audio tone played in the ear thats the install I mean obviously it feels super secure so in this case play pause is the beats logo button right here its a physical button its not a tap its not capacitive I like the idea of a physical button saying goes for volume which is on the top here hopefully Kirk can see that this is volume up and down I can tell already though before I even play music that the seal here is far more substantial in the ear canal Im sealed off a little bit from the rest of the world so therefore that the experience is more isolating that might be what you want you want to drown out all the coffeeshop noise andor the noise at the gym and things like this you can understand why you would want that but then theres the argument for the convenience factor of not necessarily fully closing off the whole world which is what happens with air pods that said Im going one layer deeper here a lot of people make the argument not with those you end up having to crank them up even louder which is ends up being worse for your hearing because youre trying to drown out ambience with more volume instead of by sealing off your your ear canals and then you can feed it less volume protect your hearing a little bit better you hear me Kirk Im gonna put hit play and then get lost for a minute here these are hiphop headphones like thats the thing you know they really shine when you feed when you feed them some bass they want to eat some bass you hit it with some hiphop and hes its thumping I mean hes doing something that the air pods cant do Id say I see less of a significant improvement with kind of classic songs where I was kind of thinking I was hoping for maybe a little bit more like where maybe there wasnt quite as much oomph but that stuff was mixed differently back then that wasnt they werent they werent too mixing for a subwoofer and and these things they really replicate the feeling of an actual subwoofer in like a car stereo like it thumps in your head when you feed it some hiphop Im sure itd be the same for a lot of pop music modern music I think these things are really tuned for modern music based on this experience here but theres more to this package I suppose like when you think about what this thing is and who its for like my feeling has become just just in this this short exposure to this particular earbud is its like a package deal type of thing I get it the way that people think about beats the brand specifically its like oh Im gonna pay a lot of money there for that logo and yes there is definitely that you get this logo right here look at that you get to wear that around boom youre gonna pay a few dollars period thats kind of the origin story of the brand you wont put dr Dres name on something prior to being acquired by Apple its gonna cost you a few bucks and thats just been the case for a while so its never really been about the value proposition its never really been about the best value for money its been about a package deal of style sound primarily in the bass department and a convenience factor which in this case is obviously a step better if you happen to be on iOS and you can utilize that H chip just like you can with the air pods this is gonna be a popular headphone period Im confident in saying its gonna be a popular headphone theres just theres just such a huge percentage of the market that wants something just as convenient as I mean Im just speculating right now like listen to me talking here Im just guessing but I assumed theres a percentage of the market that wants an air podlike experience with something that will actually stay in their ears with something that has more durability to it with something they feel like they can run around jog around bike around be more active with because there is a slight lack of confidence with the air pod even if it fits in your ear keep in mind once again I got the black air pod here color where custom air pod it just its in there I dont feel like Im gonna lose it but if I got bumped or you know took a I dont know if I was playing basketball I would not want to have this headphone in this on the other hand that would be I feel like I could wear this on the ice playing hockey and that would stay in not that I would do that that would be a crazy I did to try to play hockey with this on but like thats why Im trying to get it so its gonna have the distribution its going to be in the Apple stores its gonna have the advantage of the enhanced performance on the iOS side theyre gonna sell a lot of them its unfortunate its got to be 250 but with the air pods already being as expensive as they are its kind of like these have to be more money than that its imperative and I guess maybe they could have been 200 but theyre 250 cuz their beats lets just be honest but theyre still gonna sell a bunch of them because theyre gonna deliver a sound that a lot of people are looking for that theyre looking for that extended low end that enhancement on the bass side and theyre doing it in an overall package deal thats quite you know Im gonna be honest thats attractive to me theres nothing weird going on even the logo itself is somewhat subdued at least on this black model you dont see it unless it hits the reflection otherwise its a matte finish its pretty subdued you got the different ear tips theyre gonna sell a boatload of them for the average person should you spend 250 you could find a better value out there but I know based on the experience Ive had with the with the air pods themselves there is something to be said there is a value associated with the ease of use and integration on the iOS side like that theres an extended benefit there thats hard to put a price on specifically so from that standpoint its like where else are you going to get this pack where else are you going to get in h1 chip experience with this kind of battery life with this kind of profile in something that isnt the air pods thats a step better than the air pods like no offense to the air pods but they leave you wishing for a little bit more in a sound Department what would I mean no offense to the air bus do the air pods have feelings no they dont have feelings I said in a previous video when I did the video on the air pods Im a guy Im into headphones I got very expensive headphones theyre all over the place but I just dont find myself reaching for them as much because theyre less convenient in some way whether theyre huge or theres a cable associated they just dont go in the pocket they theres various ones that are less likely to be charged this package deal here proved to be so convenient they even though I had way better sounding headphones I found myself reaching for these and this is an extension of that this is the next step the convenience factor here it goes down a bit you get the bigger package they dont pop in on in and out of your ears quite as easily but they still have some of that origin story some of those convenient elements that come with this and for the time being that remains an exclusive item for Apple branded and of course beats branded via Apple products so thats something to keep in mind I think theyre gonna sell a bunch of them if you want a slick package if youre happy with the branding if you want to rep the B on the side if you like a lot of bass you can be happy you got to pay to play in this department no jokes they dont let you in the front door without 250 to be clear you hear me Kirk 250 thats the ticket to get in the door alright front row seats Raptors in the

shooting is it might be different after this video goes up but these are 1699 so we just need to keep that framework in our minds when evaluating these things they are cheap and they are fully wireless so they dont need to be as good as a 200 pair of earbuds they need to be good enough and save you a boatload of cash thats the idea thats why were looking at this anyhow true highdefinition sound and deep bass advanced noise cancellation well Im not sure that theres actual noise cancellation happening hopefully some isolation comfort and stability design we now know where were saving the cash for sibility made for sport builtin microphone for handsfree operation a cool and handy carry evie a box included operating range 10 meters is bluetooth for one by time 220 hours charging time 15 and the talk  playing time apparently seven hours now I gather that some of those eleven thousand individuals who decided to review these things have had that criteria at least somewhat met so theyre not just making stuff up and throwing it on the back thats my guess at least anyhow lets crack this open and see what were working with its amazing can you imagine fully wireless earbuds 1699 whats going on here okay travel case included a little bit of paperwork and thats that all right everything is in here oh all right presentation its okay so far a flat cable that goes behind your head we have some ear loops which are kind of important for you know the fitness types runners and so on you might like this style this is kind of flexible and hopefully its going to stay on a little bit better with that extra added ear loop around the outside of the ear now it does have interchangeable ear tips theyve included a bunch in here ohm comply style ear tips and then we have three sizes of your typical ear tips small medium and large and lastly a microUSB cable to charge them up pretty selfexplanatory and of course the case to keep it all in when youre not using it now the earbuds fit in like that like this well go behind here and then this will go in like this I dont know if Kirk can see that there now I guess the medium is preinstalled thats actually the medium already feels these are comfortable thats a comfortable earbud right now its got decent sound isolation with the medium tip on it and then you get the the added security of having the hook over the ear so I could be that could be at the basketball court you know I could be I could be you know Steph Curry need to pop a shot Steph Curry downstairs and stay mobile with no issue no in all seriousness these are these are on their in their and theyre on you see what I mean more comfortable than I expect it okay now on the earbuds theres a little door here a little rubber door that covers up the charge port it also has volume controls somehow so yeah they fit volume up and down on there as well so you can quickly adjust the volume oh and this button actually clicks this big see that so thats your play pause and answering phone calls and probably your power switch as well Im guessing lets see if these have any power okay they do I got power on right now your headset is connected okay lets go ahead here and a couple tunes honestly like okay heres the thing ladies and gentlemen every so often you figure something out you find something like this for the money that is just like such an easy thing to recommend these do they sound good they sound better than I expected the sound I I think the Internet in this case might be right with those 11000 reviews I dont expect them to be like crazy battery performers or anything like that but this package like with the comfort and the sound and the price its a bit ridiculous if Im being honest its like one of the best purchases in tech right now 1699 what do you got you got wired earbuds I dont know whats your Excuse like you dont want to spend a 17 you spent 17 on lunch this is a Wednesday afternoon this is a Taco Tuesday this is a champagne breakfast this is some bacon and eggs you know this is some real maple syrup because well trying to make the argument on Aunt Jemima and I just Im sorry you know thats just not where were coming from on that were talking about Quebec were talking about Ontario were talking about maple trees thats what were talking about for 1699 guys its like now I realize theres a job to be done here I need to be investigating this stuff I need to be out there on the internet uncovering finding the deals that are worth paying attention to and evaluating those youre not gonna get a big brand name in fact youre gonna get something quite the opposite your headphones are gonna be called em pal so you gotta be comfy with that you might even want to own that on another level and be like look Lou told me about the N pal I dont even care like what you got beats okay fine 1699 yo you just wasted a party and a parka and some ping pong and a pizza and some popcorn and I got all those things and my tunes so maybe its gonna be em pal for me the wireless earbuds that probably most people should own and most people are probably spending too much on these things to be honest myself included most of us need to be a little more kids because you take a peek around and theres some stuff out there you could save some cash and get some decent performance and if somebody tries to make fun of you you know I mean somebody at school youre in high school they like wet it whats these empowers youd be like okay keep chatting go watch Luke theyll let you know its all good its fine youre in great shape youre better off check the reviews its not just me its the mpow flame seems like the real deal 1699 cheeseburger fries ice cream", "video_title": "The Top Wireless Earbuds On Amazon Are Only 17",

"nuNYtj8keaE", "Closed Captions": " hey what is up guys Im QB HD here quick plug so the merch store is actually back open right now and this is the run you got to get in on if you want to get your stuff shipped in time for the holidays for getting stuff for friends family that kind of thing and theres actually some new items theres some long sleeves since its getting cold theres some stickers got a little bit of a Black Friday surprising coming for you too so definitely stay tuned for that its going to be Jones Music so today we got a few headphones in front of me and theyre all wireless headphones so he probably heard me at some point in the past year of videos say smartphones losing a headphone jack but it doesnt really bother me anymore because Ive been living that wireless life Im reviewing and using and living with these phones year after year for like the past two years all these new phones keep coming out with no headphone jack so you just kind of have to get on that train so it helped it be less painful for you I got a couple of my favorite wireless headphones in front of me these are all good certified tested I like them so first off you may have seen that tweet a couple days or weeks ago praising these Microsoft Surface headphones that I started using over the Bose that Ive been using for years little skepticism on that but these are the real deal now the Bose are still great dont get me wrong at 349 bucks ever since I reviewed them a long time before Ive even had them theyve been an industry standard for noise cancellation solid audio quality but its the awesome noise cancellation and pretty much anyone who can fly with these will do that including me until last week so these surface headphones came out they are the same price still very premium but I definitely like them now more than the Bose for that money for a couple reasons first off is the build now theyre still mostly lightweight plastics but these have this soft touch feel all the way around the headband and the ear cups are super soft and they just look more modern and clean all the way around like the rest of the surface products this little yoke angle is a small detail but it makes a big difference the way they sit on your head and they completely envelop the ear that totally over it instead of on it and its just more comfortable and that makes a big difference for people sitting on a sixhour flight that goes a long way the inputs and outputs are also a bit more modern so USB typec now for charging instead of micro USB and theres a microphone mute button and every time you turn it on a voice now says how many hours of battery left instead of your percentage and they seem to get the full 30 to 40 hours youd expect which is nice thats Cortana at work and then the dials okay so instead of a plus or minus volume button on the side that youre feeling for the whole side of the headphone is this is dial on actually both sides on the right side is just volume up or volume down on the left side of suggesting your level of noise cancellation so turning it all the way forward is turning on full noise cancellation and all the way back is all the way off plus theres an extra level that actually starts to amplify ambient sound its like the opposite of noise cancellation and its really interesting actually how well these works so when you have them in amplify mode you put them on it sort of cancels the effect of the passive noise cancellation so without it you just wouldnt hear much but with it on youd ideally like in a work environment if someone called your name youd actually be able to hear it over the music so thats decent and then as you turn it towards noise cancellation it doesnt necessarily have to be a gradient I would just kind of have it all the way off or all the way on but as you turn it all the way on youll start to see and hear sounds around you disappear so if someones talking directly to you as youre turning the dial youll hear their voice get quieter and quieter nice and then these are kind of acting like smart headphones  they have a mic the audio is paired if you long hold the side panel it activates whatever voice assistant you have Microsoft prefers Cortana you can get Cortana for Android or iOS if you want but I never really worried about that it works perfectly fine with Google assistant and it works with Siri its kind of like a cherry on top so these are my new goto flight headphones and just casual listening headphones theyre not the best audio fidelity in the world I mean theyre Wireless first of all and then theyre a little weaker in the mids and the highs than the Bose word but just as far as bluetooth streaming over Spotify these are more than fine they sound pretty good and theyre just that much more comfortable okay so that brings us to these over here these are the audio technica ath m50 bt bluetooth so they made a wireless version finally of the famous M 50s that Ive been a fan of for years and its exactly what it sounds like its literally a pair of M 50s with the wire snipped nothing too crazy or extra they charge via micro USB they have a playpause and media controls on the side and you can still plug them in if you want to and use them on a desktop overall this is really just a revival of a classic for the 2018 situation we find ourselves the comfort is the same the build and materials are the same theyre just still super flexible and adjustable and the sound signature is the same which is what I loved about these there is no noise cancellation but the passive noise isolation from the pads is pretty great so this is an awesome pair of casual listening headphones as the previous and 50s were but now theyre wireless for your phone especially if you dont need noise cancellation plus these are way cheaper so Ill leave a link to all the stuff talking about down below now of course with all of that there is fitness and working out I still kind of consider these all a little too nice to wear while working out plus I dont want to like have them fall off and break so I still stick with wireless earbuds for working out so you might expect me to go directly to the jbird run four wireless earbuds but theyre still not quite exactly what I prefer they are pretty great for their first pair of truly wireless earbuds as theyve done before they sound amazing but in your ears theres still a little bit clunky and a little bit heavy mostly thanks to the batteries so if were working out and moving around and things like that I still prefer the earbuds that have the wire connecting them in the back it doesnt bother me theres still Wireless to my phone and I just feel like they lock in my ear better theyre more comfortable so I still like these jaybird x3 has actually been my goto for a while I have multiple pairs they sound great still theyre super lightweight they stay in my ears the battery lasts forever for these tiny little earbuds like eight hours straight there is matte black or matte red or whatever color youre into and they are less expensive than the fully wireless versions so cant really ask for much more than that the jbert x4 has come out since then they are a bit more rugged and a bit more modern but theres still not USBC in fact I actually find them harder to charge so I havent felt the need to upgrade yet maybe there will be a us PC version coming soon anyway thats pretty much where were at so far for wireless headphones at least for me on I phone believe it or not air pods are still sort of the goto as far as portability and convenience weve had them in matte black in our store wink wink but these these are easily some of those popular headphones or earbuds now for iPhone that have ever existed now there are also rumors of air pods to like starting to pop up Im not sure how credible those they seem pretty early and Im also not sure what would be different about air pods  maybe wireless charging but Ill keep an eye on that and also I gotta mention Ive heard a lot about these sony 1000 XM 3 i think is what theyre called theyre again the same price as the bows and the surface headphones i havent tried them yet but a lot of people seem to like them so I may end up checking those out too but so far this is what I found I like ok thats pretty much it alright as a prize for making it to the end of the video I have a little bit of a an extra for you we have a couple extra of the audio technica ath m50 BTW you get the little early heads up that these will be in a giveaway some will be on instagram some will be on twitter so make sure youre following in these two places over the next week to get all the info for those when they come out thats pretty much it have a happy holiday thanks again for watching

relatively cheap things which you would not expect to be good and perhaps find some jewelry Photive PHBHT3 Bluetooth Wireless Headphones Ive been looking at these headphones for a long time These are wireless bluetooth headphones for about 1000 CZK Im a big fan of bluetooth headphones when I travel Convenience of bluetooth dont have that cable And believe it or not today you can get quite a decent sound even from Bluetooth headphones I have been using various types of SONY Bluetooth headphones for some time But they are expensive So maybe just maybe  we found something that fits your lifestyle and also to the limits of your bank account It can be a treasure it can be a needle in a haystack I mean Amazon with millions of headphones on it Needle  These are just Bluetooth headsets Lets take a look inside and see Which is the whole point of this damn show Slim compact shape Equipped with Bluetooth Two forty millimeter converters These are pretty big headphones on your head Fifteen hours of play with just three hours of charging Lets get to these pets Well so  It looks like we have a thousand crowns experience with unpacking No its coming Packaging Protective packaging A little silicon in the bag Activated carbon dont eat Jack have you had lunch yet gtgt Jack No So here you go Nice protective cover it says Photive Not bad for 1000 CZK Here are the headphones A little paperwork  A small pocket for your cables and such It charges via micro USB Yeah Micro USB cable is included There is also a traditional audio cable Minijack 35 millimeters Lets say youre on a plane  And you want to listen from the multimedia center inside the plane But unfortunately it does not support bluetooth So you have a cable Well see if these headphones have any energy  My interim response  You know what They look quite decent Actually a lot like my SONY The earbuds rotate There are buttons Separate volume control here switch Heres a place to charge theres a small cap Or for your separate headphone cable when youre not using Bluetooth It looks like a microphone for phone calls Start pause forward backward To switch songs while listening to music Let me try them Hmmm I dont know medium I guess its medium size But comfortable Lightweight Im a big fan of light headphones So the bridge over the head is metal Lets see if they have any energy AND I suspect I heard a beep Oh yeah Look So they flash blue and red Which I assume means they are ready for pairing Here we have them BTH3 headphones Paired For calling and media sound How simple can it be Time to listen to some music Volume for days Probably in the danger zone Wow 1000CZK Bluetooth You are honest You are  you  Now I understand why they are so well rated on Amazon I dont know man they are really comparable to my SONY Should I go for SONY Jack gtgt Jack Sure Okay give me a second They are very comparable to these But these are for 3500  The layout of the buttons is actually almost identical Ill try the same song Lets find out SONY sounds a little better a little more readable And I would also say that they are much more comfortable A little lighter But these are the real heroes in this video because they are not even in the same price range Like its hard to get a good pair of wired headphones for 1000 CZK And these are bluetooth and have great sound at 1000  They have a great sound Sounds better than I expected And the processing is also better than I would expect Okay another episode of Does It Suck And another surprised version of Lew Right in front of you For you for your relatives pro  the girl you like Bluetooth headphones Bluetooth headphones for everyone Many thanks for watching Give me a thumbs up below if you value the content And Ill catch you again soon as usual in the next episode

trip to get here and so on Ive been testing a certain pair of new headphones so you guys may have seen the pictures you may have seen the tweets it is already my new alltime favorite pair of wireless noise cancelling cans this is over the bose QC 35 2 s this is over the Microsoft Surface headphones its the Sony WH 1000 X and threes terrible name but these are the real deal honestly theres really not all that much you have to do to really nail a pair of this category of over ear noise cancelling headphones so youve got to sound great you have to have good noise cancellation and then you just have to be somewhat comfortable and have a fairly good feature set and as you might imagine since Im talking about him like this these male all of those so right off the bat with the sound these sound excellent theyre full rich and clear with the sound they have more range and more deep bass than the Bose but without being overwhelming and short of studio headphones this is a great sounding crisp clean pair of drivers and the noise cancellation is actually a bit better than the Bose I was already sacrificing a little bit when I switched to surface headphones I think those surface headphones had slightly worse sound and slightly worse active noise cancellation but I loved the design and the comfort and USB typec and the dials and all of that so that put them over the top for me these Sonys though sound better than both are better at noise cancellation than both and they have a great design basically as soon as I heard these I knew I liked them and theyve been sort of growing on me ever since and also I wore these for five and a half hours straight on the flight to get here and they only really started to get tight by the end of those five and a half hours so design wise I think these are kind of great and thats something Bose has always been king at these are lightweight like those the cups have a good amount of padding the top band is padded there are plenty flexible enough to not be squeezing your head all the time and getting uncomfortable and then they beat the bows by being USB typec its actually funny a lot of people see these and immediately think this this copper accent at the top and it looks like the USBC port but its not thats actually the microphone at the top of both ear cups the USBC port is down here at the bottom but yeah you can use the same charger as you already have for your phone or your laptop or whatever other USB see things you have and the battery life lives up to the 20 plus hours longer than the surface headphones its great okay Im really raving about these Im making them sound pretty perfect trust me though theyre not perfect nothings perfect I think in an ideal world I would combine these with the surface headphones and their their dials and their design I think those those function a little bit better but here are some things about these that arent quite perfect first of all my number one complaint is the controls there are only two physical buttons on these all the rest of the controls all the rest of the work is all done by swiping and tapping on the right ear cup which is a small touchpad so double tap to play and pause swiping up and down to change the volume and forward and backward to change tracks it can be a bit fidgety it doesnt work every time but you kind of get used to it another thing is when you take the headphones off they just keep playing like normal headphones but the surface headphones would detect when you took them off your head and theyd pause and when you put them back on they would keep playing again these dont and I kind of miss that and then the two buttons that are physical on these are the power button and the noise cancellation  ambient mode switch which by default doubles as the Google assistant button so you can hold it to speak and talk to Google assistant which is cool without ever you know taking your phone out your pocket you can ask Google assistant a question out loud and itll answer that question it can also read your notifications when you ask it to but even with all of that I still prefer the surface headphones physical dials still for volume and then there is also what is known as the cold weather issue with these headphones there been a couple reports about it or articles about it but basically when you take these out in you know freezing conditions or subzero weather apparently the touch pads will start to register phantom touches so without you ever touching them itll start to play and pause your muse and change the volume and the tracks and randomly stop playing thats pretty rough now I have been using these outside you know as low as 40 degrees Fahrenheit so not below freezing but I havent had this issue yet to with as cold as it is in some parts of the world right now its worth noting that these do seem to have that issue and I dont know if it can be fixed with a software update it may be possible but as of right now if theres a cold weather issue that makes these unusable in certain climates thats kind of a bummer so I have to let you guys know about it also these headphones come with a good hard case like most other over your headphones but I find that the way they fold is really annoying maybe its just that I havent gotten used to it yet but thats a small nitpick honestly the case itself is fine and if wind or anything blows hard enough down on you from above the mics on the top will pick that up and youll hear it as a sort of a fuzzy static I only notice this because when Im on the airplane which is where a lot of people will listen to these I had the vents above me and they were blowing down like directly into those microphones so you just kind of adjust that anger fine oh and the left ear cup has an NFC logo on it that can be used to tap to pair on the side of the headphones with an NFC naval device so thats pretty cool Im gonna start using that more often to connect or to disconnect but these headphones only pair to one device at a time and that might not sound like a big deal but when you get used to headphones with multiple device connectivity and seamless switching that is a big time convenience with these surface headphones or any other pair of headphones that supports multiple devices you can be playing something like literally music from your phone on the headphones pull out your iPad which is already paired to the headphones and hit play on some video or Netflix or whatever youre doing and itll instantly take over on the headphones and theres seamless switching back and forth between devices without dealing with the frustration of Bluetooth with these you still have to deal with the pain of Bluetooth sometimes being kind of fidgety and not connecting on the first try and having to do it again and the whole pairing process is kind of annoying so yeah just I hope the next version of these that they make the m4s have that multiple device connectivity but these dont I wish they did I really missed that but other than that I I love these headphones theyre matte black mostly all the way around which you know I love but you also got this little copper accent at the top with the sony logo and the microphones and its also on the zipper of the hard case so how they look is great how they sound is great how they feel is great theyre ideal for flying of course and theyre also the go to pick for just travel headphones in general and and theyre just great for cancelling out the noise of an office or a coffee shop or really anywhere that noise canceling headphones are good so yeah thats thats pretty much all there is to say about headphones Im just glad these ended up on my radar so shout out to those of you who are leaving comments on the videos shoutout to vipre for yelling at me on his livestream to go buy these shout out to everyone in the comment section of my last headphones video that got me to actually pick these up and im glad im using them now these are now permanent backpack material so ill drop a link below if you guys want to check these out for yourself Ill leave a link to the other headphone video but thats basically it thanks for watching Im gonna go back to working on that secret project now catch you guys in the next one peace", "video_title": "Sony WH1000XM3 Review A New ANC King", "video_comment_count": "67170",

"7DMDA5pde0", "Closed Captions": " Bos is back I dont know maybe its possible noise cancelling headphones 700 cant say I love the name who cares about the need when theyre on your head you dont care about the name anymore you wear them Bose is like look were getting beat up out there we were on airplanes everybody had the QC series on their heads okay with a champs standing around flexing their muscles we dont have to change very much QC everybody knows theyre everywhere the previous generation of these headphones and then up until I guess a year ago or whenever those Sony headphones dropped with the crazy model name XM 3 1000 wh blah blah blah and guys like me and others on youtube start talking about those ones saying hey man theres theres some updated features here plus these sound good plus Sony caught up on the noise canceling Tech and all son Bose had to do some and this is the answer this is where the 700 comes in this is the answer to all those videos all those comments and in particular that Sony product thats my feeling on the matter no Im not its not an official line from Bose Im just saying that product is in this products crosshairs premium sound world class adjustable noise cancelling industry leading voice pick up your choice of voice assistant intuitive touch control on ear cup this elite product had that they did say choose your own voice assistant so it appears you can use this either with Google assistant or Alexa unboxing experience looking kind of nice so far you see this Jack look at that frustrationfree no knife necessary I appreciate that guy opening Im into the package right now you see all right different material a faux leather type of feel silica gel havent seen in a while I almost hit the lens unzips like almost all the way around it also comes in black if you want the more executive look it has a futuristic look to it wow those are nicelooking right away Im gonna say I prefer the appearance to the Sony headphones look at that its almost its weird to see but rather than the headband itself making the adjustment the adjustment happens inside the ear cup and then this pivots so its actually got multiple accesses to work with from spin way and then the angle with which it fits on your head depending on your your setup your skull set up finally we have Type C charging still has an analog connector now unfortunately I dont they call it 25 millimeter but come on like if were gonna do this lets do the 35 Im so nervous about that connector thats a bit scary how small that is is it a big deal probably not for most people I mean once its in there its actually quite secure and its gonna be 35 on the other side obviously to connect with your analog sources also in the package type C cable I like how two cables are the same color as the headphone also this is genius right here your cables fit in and then this guy is magnetic this is a perfect little cubby now this bit of paperwork right here indicates that the whole thing is a touch pad now lets go ahead and power it up the headband it kind of seems like the headphone was designed around the headband this is all like a really soft touch material like a like a silicone something like that these are crazy comfortable theyre light the noise cancelling is already on ok searching nearby were in the app right now it sees the headphones straight away were gonna add the product so weirdly enough is that on disconnect it now maybe I have to finish the set of gear huh no when you turn it on it tells you how much time is left on the battery not the percentage thats 6 hours and 13 minutes or something no know exactly whats going on here in the app because it says Im connected to it but Im showing connected to it right now but the app is not adding it all right so I feel the need to kind of mention just what went on I was just setting these up I had a 1  7 Pro over here and it just refused to connect in a fashion like image in a way that I would have expected so through the Bose music app which appears to be somewhat busted at the moment I couldnt get it to recognize the headset itself tried a number of different things restarting the app the phone disconnecting forgetting the Bluetooth device weirdly enough the headset connects and allows you to listen to music but youre kind of missing some of the features or at least the UI associated with the app which is part of the thats the way you want to interact with a headset like this that has the ability and the configurability ultimately for the noise canceling in the various attributes and so forth so pulled out an iPhone and an app on an iPhone was also a bit buggy but after a couple of restarts I was finally able to get it to pop up in its proper fashion so I think theres some software work that needs to be done on boses end but for the purpose of this video Im just gonna use the iPhone because it appears to be working here but thats kind of I mean its gonna be a lot of upset people will do was just looking it up because were like wait are we doing something wrong and he found what 13 pages but people that have had similar issues so Im not saying its gonna permanently be like that theyre definitely seeing those pages and hopefully they update it but and the headphones still work if you connect them just like any other Bluetooth device without the app but I dont think you want to use them that way so I think theyre gonna address it I think theyll fix it but anyway this is what the app looks like as you can see it represents your headset I like that its the actual color of my headset as well I like the fact that it represents the battery life in ours it tells you that when you first turn them on as well you have some other settings here for Bluetooth and the amount of noise canceling which I actually kind of like the simplicity of this implementation on the Sony product based on the audio input through the microphone array it can guess what the situation is and try to adjust from there this one is a little bit more simple where its just gonna tell you okay youre at a level seven right now lets see whats in the settings here settings you can set up your product name okay so you can have three sets of favorites for noise canceling and toggle between them Im assuming using the hardware button on the well headphones alright so Im gonna start at zero and then slowly toggle up the noise canceling to see the impact Im gonna put these back on my head here first thing to note here having these on at a zero setting is actually kind of beyond zero so you may think of zero as like okay no noise cancelling but youre gonna have the isolation associated with the ear cup thats not what it is I would consider it almost a plus because right now the microphones are feeding through to my ears I can hear my surroundings perfectly like its like Im not wearing headphones I could have a conversation with you Kurt I could have a conversation with you Jack say a few words Jennifer to people out how he says uh uh he says um hello a test 90s hiphop here we go okay killing me softly thats a great start now I can still hear my own voice okay Fuji sounds alright nobody remembers Pras except he did have a hit track actually he didnt have a hit of his own after the Fugees and it was part of soundtrack to that movie called Bulworth and the song was ghetto superstar you see what I just did heres prize right here the supreme being team hoping up on the scene and there was um that selling raps Halle Berry was in the movie sound quality they sound good Im not blown away at a zero setting just for the purpose of Im going all the way to ten oh wow its such an odd let me play the music now Music you know theyre good sounding headphones Im not hmm Im not blown away its not Magic Kingdom theyre in the same territory and wheelhouse you know like I could interchange these with the other ones that Ive been using the thing thats kind of a little upsetting to me is the app some of the EQ stuff and the enhancement stuff on on a Sony site actually it really changes your experience lets you tune in your experience thats kind of missing here a little bit comparatively this feels futuristic to me looks futuristic Beaus gonna sell a lot of these theyre gonna sell for years on a momentum of having been at the forefront of that noisecanceling situation but I really do feel that Sony has caught up in their latest flagship headphone products theyve caught up to a point now where its not necessarily obvious why youre going this direction and the way youre gonna make this decision has less to do with noise cancelling performance and more to do with these various other attributes that Im mentioning because to me its not mega discernable and I if I had to give an edge I actually might even give it still give it to the Sony headphones think the major edge here is in the the clout associated with the name and the futuristic appearance this is a slightly more ambitious and therefore potentially iconic design whats my price on this Willie do so its 400 now I know through discounts a Sony guy coming down 350 350 50 difference now its gonna be a hard choice for you youre not gonna go terribly wrong either direction the Android app thing you know gave me a bit of a scare not gonna lie I assume Bose is gonna fix it Bose youre watching this video go fix the Android app please okay I honestly cant steer you one way or the other I give the app edge right now to Sony theres a few more features and functions the overall sound potential with the configurability and so forth probably to the Sony the package the design of giving it to this practice product wins in there so youve got to decide I guess where lines up for you I will be completely happy to wear that thing and get it in the silver as well so it looks even more futuristic youre on your Jetsons vibe Star Trek Star Wars Stargate Star everything",

shell go through if youre trying to buy the best affordable pair of truly wireless earphones honestly I think a lot of people just get overwhelmed and say forget it Ill just pony up the dough for some air pods but that sucks air pods are expensive which is why we bought the top50 wireless earphones for under 100 from amazoncom and went through the pain staking tedium of trying out every single one of them so stick around and Ill tell you which ones suck and why and which select few are actually worth a closer look but first a closer look at our sponsor Origin PC customized an Origin PC desktop powered by an NVIDIA GeForce rtx graphics card pair with a GC monitor for a fast refresh rate and an edge on your competition learn more at the link below first well eliminate the ones that obviously suck Relaxo tws i7o this case is brutal these feel super cheap no youre done okay oh this is a big boy what are these what kind of design is that like its so far from my head why something any sense this one actually has a nice weight to it like its kind of heavy in a good way although Im not sure that I would want anything in my pocket to be heavier than it needs to be its a little hard to open though which is annoying but Shante you stay okay for sixty dollars this is not an acceptable charging case this is annoying to have in your pocket or whoa it actually recognizable brand nice buttons that I really like the skin on them these are actually pretty cool hold up why is this so huge its only 400 really amphours this one 600 not a chance youre done oh these are a little different okay whoa wait a second this has a lid I can lose whoa okay it snaps on there pretty good Im not gonna eliminate them now for that was close focus power f10 this is theres only one really what are you thinking theres only one unbelievable okay focus power its your chance at redemption thats a nice lid noise okay these are maybe the nicest one so far and finally skull candy I used to think these were so cool when I was a kid but Im giving these a hard no these are pretty bad especially for the price Music Oh like this is a nice tactile button but its a way too loud oh yeah thats just right in my brain next now these buttons these are nice doesnt take a lot of force you can skip tracks forward and backwards you can play in pause and those operations are what Im gonna consider baseline for all these headphones here these are pretty good unfortunately you do have to use your phone to adjust volume up and down though but these can stay ok these ones these actually have a touch interface for 20 bucks which is pretty awesome and they have volume control on the ear but cant be that right well except that its kind of Jencks so to turn the music up you just hold it down which is sweet because you can just hold your finger there and crank it but to hold it down you have to tap it and you might think ok if you want to turn it on fast you just tap really fast but no because thatll register a double tap which is a different command these ones are even worse its three taps to adjust the volume but only two taps to Hale the assistant so I just keep getting the assistant more like pass on me am i right Im right cant skip tracks backwards these bad boys actually have dedicated buttons for volume up and down on each earphone but theyre so small and hard to press that you end up kind of jamming the whole earphone into your ear every time you press them and not only that but theyre asymmetrical on this one the volume buttons back here and on this one the volume buttons at the front strike three Music finally this is the only pair of the whole lot that gets the interface right in my opinion single tap for pause double tap for next triple tap for back hold on the right one for volume up hold on the left one for volume down nailed it you stay tech taka Enka fire going ovate andrade max the tribe has spoken now this round is completely subjective but my ears really like the fit of the Ray Connie 50s and this sound with bionics these are not going anywhere I did not like the rock and pace because a they hurt and B even though the round you do have to take care of when you put them in so that its button is kind of facing out so you can actually access it and even then you usually have to use two fingers to press the button these ones just hurt these ones also hurt and when I pulled it out of my ear the ear tip actually got stuck in my ear and thats unsettling so I still have about 20 pairs of headphones left and at this point theyre mostly okay so rather than finding reasons to eliminate them instead Im gonna identify the keepers that stood out to me during my testing well weve shared an incredible week together and its one of the hardest decisions Ive ever had to make but I only have ten roses gee whack will you accept this rose treble of x5 will you accept this rose sound core rate Connie 50s burek or 3x e 20s f16 branya will you accept this rose and for my final rose Music by on it will you accept this rose introducing my top 10 after one of the toughest days of the office ever I was able to separate the wheat from the chaff and narrow down to the final four which I think are all good for different reasons starting with the cheapest these get sold under many different names on Amazon but the ones that we have are called the G WAC jay29 theyve got the best button interface of the whole bunch a case thats reasonably compact despite its 800 milliamp battery and absolutely pounding bass which is great if you listen to EDM or hiphop but can be a bit overbearing if you listen to metal next its the sound with bionics which are my pick for a budget truly wireless to use while exercising on account of the great fit theyre just super in there and the nice rubber sleeves the case isnt my favorite but it does the job these are just kind of allaround decent bumping up in price the Ray cons are back and they might be my overall top pick these sound great with any genre unless youre like a total bass head and they have the absolute best voice alerts they have fantastic battery life theyre just nice to use Oh God and they come in multiple colors and finally weve got the JBL free ex they were at the top of our price limit but the sound from these to me seemed like a cut above the rest theyre just super clear at least until you max out the volume the case is a bit large but it is 1500 milliamp hours netting you 5 extra charges and the list so satisfying its like youre basically getting a free fidget toy in the box now to be clear were not saying that no one should buy premium wireless earphones like apples air pods or power beats pros if you want something thats very likely to be good and comes with warranty support that you can count on then those are totally an option but for everyone else we are really confident that you will probably like any of these especially for the cost so go check them out at the link in the description the Flair mini from sound core by Anchor has a ton of great features its got 360 degree audio which means it sounds great from every direction it features neodymium drivers as well as their base up technology for the dual passive radiators and of course their halo LED for that RGB its got a bunch of light effects with audio fireworks it can phase pulse and glow with the rhythm its

havent had it youve got to go out and get something Ive had to take a shower just now because I reaped of like charcoal beef pork whatever Im saying like its a bad thing right here damn it I should review food for god sakes anyways staying focused I have my list of the best truly wild earphones that Ive personally tested compared and provided videos on right here on this channel as you guys know Im here to help you guys make that purchase decision check out the pros and cons in their respective videos down in that video description also if you need the most updated prices in real time our place might feel linked down in that video description below as well click on those links to see if theyre on sale hopefully theres some deals going on at the moment dont pay retail Im telling you these things are always slashing prices anyways folks lets start here with number 5 here is the smallest lightest and least cumbersome truly round earphones that you can buy if these Samsung Galaxy buds now why are they on my list they sit basically the most flush against my ears they stay in ridiculously well and the case is the smallest that Ive tested probably so far on the channel you get the latest technology which is USB see you get wireless charging and fast charging with the case the next set of features is audio passthrough if you want to hear your environment you could have your audio pumped in with the builtin microphones so you dont get assaulted robbed hit by bus all at the same time here you probably having a crappy day but anyways here you basically hear your environment for safety and awareness you hear me mention audio pastor quite a bit throughout this video now better life is rated at 6 hours and with my test I got 6 hours and 24 minutes of realworld testing and this is on par with many other truly wireless earphones on the market you also get Bluetooth 50 on the earphone the Bluetooth technology played perfectly fine with video as well with my more recent tests on my new pixel for Excel and last you do get multi paired if you need to switch your Bluetooth source just tap on the latest device and the audio will basically switch over now the earphones offers touch sensitivity controls skipper go back on your music theres no physical buns found on these things here and I personally like that youre also getting an app where you can find your earbuds if you ever forget them somewhere or if you freaking lose them or so but part of the galaxy buds number five and not higher or basically lower on this list the waterproofing is unfortunately limited to an IP two rating which is one of the lowest that Ive seen the IP two designation means you can only get water on days up to a 15 degree angle this cant even take on a splash of water doesnt mean you shouldnt buy these as you might not sweat like some and you might not bend over more than 15 degrees here you might not need the waterproofing at all its your call now also in busy environments phone calls did absolutely terrible from my testing as demonstrated in my review but for the breadandbutter here how is the audio the guilty but I think are perfect as everyday earbuds for casual listening to it from work and the type of earbuds that if you do lose them youll be pissed but you wont be like damn I ate ramen for several weeks to save up for these kind of pissed hopefully that makes sense and these are around 100 or so give or take 20 as Ive seen them on sale all over the place here dont pay retail click on my felt links that in at the description ident for the most updated prices alright folks lets get into number four the best budget non namebrand a little bit of a smaller company type of earphones who has the best budget your phones on the market I kept going back to the Aki T tens now theyre not as flush against my ears or minimus looking as the galaxy buds but its very reasonable and if anything very similar to other small truly wireless earphones out there in regards to size but for a very similar price of the Galaxy buds you get bluetooth 50 you get USB C and the case you also get better better life at up to seven hours you get better waterproofing at an IP five rating which means that it can take on low pressure water jet sprays you get wireless charging thats so many more expensive models dont even get and I personally like Lee touch sensitivity surface over the physical buttons you do get that here and I did test this with video YouTube and Netflix played perfectly fine without lipsyncing issues which were notorious on other older truly wireless earphones now the icing on the cake the audio is better than the Samsung Galaxy buds it took me by surprise but the audio direction here and the soundstage is there and it sounded great for a 100 price range pair of truly wireless earphones the only thing here though that didnt make it basically it was complete letdown for me theres no audio pass through I love it when I have the option to hear my environment again for safety and awareness you dont get that with the t10 and lastly carrying case again USB C wireless charging in again slim enough for me right here it is a unique design but sometimes the earphones snag a bit when I try to put them back in a switch when I first bought it you need to build up a little bit of muscle memory know if youre okay with those two little hiccups here no audio pass through in the cases little little funky hears in the very beginning that is I still highly recommended t10 so theres tons of value when I reviewed him they were on sale I would highly recommend them keep eye on these give them a try again links are down in that video description alright moving on number three here who has the best audio performance now I know its not my number one pick here and it seems kind of odd since he sounds so freaking good but Ill get into detail why very soon but these are the best sounding no question when I want the gym the hell out I pop these blingy earphones in today indeed ascend hazard momentum true Wireless has these same specs as the best of the best out there such as Bluetooth 50 USB see the case looks freaking good here I confirm these works great with video as well you get this thing called app X that confirms that these earphones can transfer audio at a higher bitrate than most out there you get waterproofing and an IP 4 rating which means that this cant take out splashes it doesnt take out those low jet sprays as I mentioned earlier audio pastor is available and it sounds quite natural here I like it touch controls are at your fingertips and in general they look pretty nice in my opinion as for comfort the earphones are a bit thick good for casual everyday use theyre perfectly fine they stay to my ears really well for working out though Im sure some of you guys dont have this issue but for me they are just big and round here I can confidently say they might work for some people but Im telling you theres more secure earphones out there if your focus is on work out earphones now the reason why these are number three on my list and not any higher is particularly due again to the ergonomics like I said they work fine but something a bit more secure for everyone would have been great but ranking these at number three is largely due to its battery performance five hours is what Sennheiser is claiming and Im only getting three hours at 40 minutes from our world test several have mentioned better life does drain while the earphones are in the charging case and Im aware every charge case does have a standby time some better than others but with these Sennheisers here theyre really low Im usually around five to six days I dont think they fixed it just yet and I havent noticed it at least comment down below if you guys own these things here and see if this is still happening to you guys how about the Jims room community let us know now as for audio this is the biggest reason why you would actually buy these here beautiful punchy bass thats very controlled a midrange that stands out and a lot of depth and dimension and the one area thats very hard to do on these truly rounds earphones for some odd reason here is the audio direction in a very good sound stage right here now they said eyes are true Wireless Momentums here makes me nod to my music it takes me away at times with the right song it simply uh performs everything else on this list in regards to audio I know Sennheisers have come down in price and for those who have been waiting this might be the time to jump on these things again most updated prices are in that video description this was earphone number three now number two here best workout earphones it came down to these three power feet pros Jabra 675 Cs that is whoops and BJ Bird boosters the power B pros didnt provide the best base out of the three which might be shocking for many here but what it does have is excellent in seamless parent theres multi parent with devices that switches back and forth ridiculously easy theres better life thats class leading at nine hours and possibly the biggest reason why you would pick is over the others are the earhooks I love these things as no matter what I do obviously these things never fall off if you dont like inear earphones like all the other truly your phones on this list these actually sits somewhat on the outside of your ear can oh they technically dont jam in there now there is water resistance and these although directly on beats website it doesnt have an ingress rating but there is some form of water protection that is claimed I drew some water all over these things here and Im still using my power B pros say day now the drawbar 75 tees Im really liking as theyre almost as small and as light as these Samsung Galaxy buds but provides much better audio theres an IP five water resistant rating making these protected against not just splashes but also again those low pressure water jet sprays battery life is above average at it claimed seven and a half hours the drummers are quite straightforward with the essentials like audio passthrough multi parent Bluetooth 50 us PC Im in charging case and also fast charging you just dont get wireless charging on this thing look how slim this thing is to now the J professors also have similar features like bluetooth 50 USB C fast charging and such the IP rating on this is actually a number seven meaning this can be submerged underwater for a short period of time this part of the most rugged out of the entire list that I have here now one of the biggest perks here the jaybird app with its builtin equalizer on the many features that its on that app allows you to finetune the audio to your liking and it is very very responsive but audio quality wise though I compared the Jaybirds with the other two and shockingly the others offers a bit more finesse you can say the vistas sound signature is very loud its inyourface and many of the audio frequencies are very punchy and sharp you might like that at the time of the review when I did this several months ago although the equalizer is available and it does help though but some of that aggressive characteristics are unfortunately still there now although the draw bras were heavily bass boosted when I first bought them before tuning them as you can always turn them down within their app as well theres a little builtin equalizer once and compare them backtoback comparing to the vistas that Jarrah sounded cleaner compared to the power B pros this has the jobbers had a little bit more character a little bit more dimension to it Audio so in the end here I went with the Java 75 Ts for the best workout earphones I used to love the Jaybirds they still fit great they have excellent features loved their app but theres just better audio out there nowadays now I love the ear hooks on the power B pros but I like the audio the best I need Jabra 75 Ts its just comfortable its light its small and just enough for me you can say that John 475 Ts are happy very much right temperature again folks all the updated prices are down in that better description below for you guys to check out alright folks so in the last category here who has the best active noisecancelling earphones many of you guys are wondering which one is better Apple earpods or the Saudi WF 1000 X M threes here is a quick rundown so Sony I think looks better it looks classier it looks less sterile than the Apple air pub pros they dont stick up past my ears which is great thats just in general but they are further extended from my ear canal and dont necessarily fill out the bowl of my ear in turn if youre a pretty active person they do tend to bounce a little more than the ear pod pros and yes Ive tried all the ear tips and really twisted them into my ears for a nice seal but speaking of being active if you do sweat a lot I wouldnt risk it the Sonys unfortunately dont have any waterproofing and I dont sweat a lot and I dont run in the rain of course so to be fair that isnt a dealbreaker depending on your situation now the air pad pros here have these little stems which do look a lot better than any previous generations in addition the new ear tips are now in your earphones with the older models they usually sit on the outside of your ear canal in turn they didnt provide a barely any passive noise isolation the new ear pad pros although they do sit in the ear canal a little bit more provide a little bit more passive noise isolation they are comfortable it hands down more comfortable than the 1000x m3s for my small ears now I would highlight this part here for the Apple earpods they stay in the ear ridiculously well while feeling the least intrusive it is light its Airy I can run jog and jump with these things on and Ive never had an issue with them also these are water resistant with an IP 4 rating MIDI they can take out a splash of water unlike the Samsung Galaxy buds you can actually bend over with these and get water on them but no exaggeration anyways they fit amazingly now getting two features none of these mofos have volume controls what the hell I know you can use your voice assistance or whip out your phone but when Im barlas I wanna be away from my phone at the gym I dont want to take the phone out when Im in another room I dont want to go grab the phone just adjust volume when Im trying not to use my phone as my fan say she thinks Im on tinder when my phone are in my skinny jeans and I cant get them out because my jeans are too tight I mean I dont know I dont wear skinny jeans Im actually wearing sleeping pants right now but anyways besides the point here Im just joking with you guys well except the pants I like I said I just got out the shower here but you guys get the idea now what you do get though in the features Department sony has a lot touch controls who pause and play in other various actions you do get audio pastor you get adaptive noise cancelling that adjusts ANC based on your movements which kind of work is not a hundred percent per my review with the air pods theyre pros the connection on these things work slightly faster and it feels seamless when switching between devices Sony does great but theres just something about Apple that gives it a bit more finesse basically the air pod pros have a force sensor where you can squeeze to pause and play and skipping on your music but if you hold down the left ear phone you can activate audio pastor or turn on or off active noisecancelling now as a side of the noise canceling does work or the button features do work with Android as well you dont need an iPhone which is pretty cool now both have bluetooth 50 both play perfectly fine with video with no syncing delays both have fast charging and as for battery life peruse I never realised this but when I test the Sony months ago I achieved six hours in 23 minutes I recently tested the air pod pros I also achieved the same exact results six hours in 23 minutes at 50 vibe with ANC on at 100 on both and with the same exact playlist its quite interesting so I got to give it to Apple for comfort Sony for looks and style I guess it just really boils down to active noise cancelling and audio performance now I recently tested them back to back again here and for the active noisecancelling performance the earpods canceled more noise I know reviewers were saying the Sony did better Im gonna stand my ground on this one I noticed Apple cancels out more on the lowend audio frequency than Sony did in general also people talking nearby Sena to be canceled more so on the Apple earpods pros again more than hes Sony WF 1000x m3s and Ive done this back to back and Im multiple occasions now over the past month or so that was just my experience and it is has been consistent but honestly when you have music going on either one of these youre honestly fine the passive noise isolation plus whichever device you choose with the ANC going on plus whatever music youre playing that already cant sell a lot of your environmental noises already I would say if you listen to podcast or listen to audio very low in general I would favor the air pods in this case but if youre going music heavy now Sony takes the cake the air pod pros provides very clean easy to listen to and pleasing a pleasing audio signature that is its distortion free its clear its consistent all great but the Sony as cheesy as it sounds I just nod to my music a little bit more often its bass here theres a bit more dimension on these Sonys a bit more depth to my music and not to mention the EQ within the Sony app provides a bit more versatility as well the audio simply sounds better on a WF 1000 XM threes so with all these choices here which one is my best earphone for the year here now honestly there isnt one but there is one that somewhat takes almost all these boxes for the time being maybe not the best in one category but it does well overall and you got to give some praise to the thats the draw bruh 75 Ts that gets my pick if I can find it on my table here now you get the latest features again bluetooth 50 audio pastor great for video no syncing delays theres the battery life is slightly above average rated at seven and a half hours this has multi pairing a very small carrying case a very good waterresistant rating although the drummers uses buns but theyre very sensitive and works flawlessly not to mention you get all the controls including volume theyre not as small the Samsung Galaxy buds but there these smaller ones small the truly rods earphones that have tested on the market at the moment you guys can see here its really discreet here now although they dont have ear hooks like the power B pros to keep these earphones on my ears no matter what though theyre much better than maybe big and huge really where I listen your phones out there during my time testing with them running Ive never had an issue with them and they stay in the ear really really well they look good they sound good again not as good as the 350 retail price for these Sennheiser Momentums but definitely the Jabra 75 Ts dont sound as cheap as the 100 price range it comes with an app to tune these things as well to your liking and although this doesnt have active noise canceling Jabra actually promotes this and I did confirm this within my test during my review these actually have very good passive noise isolation for truly wireless earphones I actually hear myself my own voice is a little bit muffled right now so as you guys can see with my quick run down list with a dropper 75 Ts these are the most well rounded pair of truly worlds ear phones Ive encountered so far if you do buy them as I mentioned in my review let the earphones burn in for several days of use that is and definitely use the app to turn down the bass just a smidge right there they are pretty bass heavy earphones but overall this might not blow every category out the water but it has ticked the most boxes on my list out there in my humble opinion I highly highly recommend they drop or 75 Ts so folks this video is long as free curette now please like this video to help support my work here its been a long year and a lot of test to get this list literally together for you guys I really hope it does help you in some way comment down below which one is your favorite or which one youre planning on buying like I said I havent tested all of them recommend them down in that comment section bring it to my attention you might see it on the channel again social media channels right there for you guys click and follow and Ill catch you guys on the next one bye", "video_title": "Top

"video_id": "SXyObZahuo", "Closed Captions": " You must know that I am a headset lover There are definitely hundreds of headphones I have tried in the past few years I have been looking for the next one may be the best and perfect earphone Too many headphones on the market Audiophile headphones home audio Backless headphones noisecancelling headphones inear headphones completely wireless headphones Airpods And this one in front of me I think its a great headphone rookie The kind of earphones that you carry with you every day put it in your bag and bring it on the plane This is PXC550 Wireless or wired environmentadaptive noise reduction headphones This is a heavy feature of this headset you can see that there are written on the box Ordinary noisecanceling headphones are a bit annoying for me Because his noise reduction mode is unchanged noise reduction can only be turned off or on This headset can adaptively change the noise reduction mode Up to 30 hours of battery life Foldable I want to use headphones anytime anywhere but only if its portable enough Someone may be thinking wait how does he know this headset so much why does he like this headset so much The box is not opened yet No no let me tell you I have used this headset for a year My instinct tells me that this is the headset I want So lets open the box and test to see if this is the headset I want Touchpad on the side Very intuitive operation You can even doubleclick to turn off noise reduction This feature is great This way you dont need to take off the headphones and you can hear them The operation of changing songs is very intuitive Sliding forward and backward Control the volume Take a look at feature richness You can use this headset in various ways Various ways to enjoy music There is Bluetooth 42 NFC pairing function Just touch the phone no need for complicated pairing Aptx HiFi audio The Noisegard function of this headset uses four microphones Of course there is also a microphone for making calls OK the earphones are out this is a travel bag As you can see this travel bag is quite slim Take a look at this little thing Moe There is also a bag with various adapters I tried it the cable works well but unfortunately if you want to use it with Pixel 2XL you still have to adapt Inlight microphone There are also control buttons if you dont want to use the touchpad to control this can come in handy This headset has a small detail I like very much Is the way the headset is turned on No power button You just need to unfold the headset into its normal form and it will be turned on This design is so genius you dont need to turn it on There is a physical button to control the degree of noise reduction From 0 to 1 to 50 Also the sound effect button According to the song you listen to use this button to change the sound effect of the headset Finally this should be my favorite switch Here a dedicated Bluetooth button This way you know whether Bluetooth is on or off Take a look Bluetooth is on good Now I think I need to wear headphones to let you know why this headset is so great I put on headphones A good seal is formed on both sides look at this shape Is the shape of the human ear Streamlined design Streamlined materials and light weight This headset is really super light This design is to let you enjoy music and movies better If a headset is uncomfortable to wear then the sound quality is not important Once Will wore this headset I asked him What do you think He said I cant even notice his existence when it is light So this is not just my side The soft rubber on the top and sides of the earphones are very comfortable Sound insulation is great Noise reduction mode and nonnoise reduction mode you can hear the difference immediately Then I double click on the touchpad Nonnoise reduction mode Has been activated I can hear my own voice Can hear Wills voice I can just go out and order a Frappuccino with headphones They might think Im a bit antisocial so they dont talk to me You know its pretty cold outside Everyone will encounter this kind of thing and you are no exception Then you go back to noise reduction mode and the music starts Of course sometimes you still have to talk to people They made an app called Captune So you can adjust it to your liking Here you can adjust Noisegard it is now 50 But i can turn it down Adjust to 30 or directly 100 I can adjust it here I can use the physical button to adjust it or I can turn it off directly Noisecanceling headphones have a place that annoys me If I am at home it is quiet So why should I consume power to reduce noise And those noisecanceling headphones are made like a fish tank You can directly see the remaining power of the headset which is also very important But its not over yet you can use this as a music player Multiple library options The software also has a builtin equalizer Various presets such as Hiphop Rock Flat Of course you can also customize the configuration yourself FX takes effect on the basis of the equalizer and the effect button on the headset is used for this purpose From clubs to movies to speeches to director mode This is very important You want to enjoy the best sound quality of movies and music You might want more bass Listen to music and want a stronger thrust Want better movie sound effects better speech effects and clearer sound Can choose Okay finally Im going to try listening to music Im going to try a few more styles of music Try listening to hiphop in club mode There is a volume setting on the phone but dont forget that you can also control it on the headset Hello I want to order a Frappuccino Macchiato Bye If you listen to hiphop The effect of this headset will never let you down Excellent sound insulation abundant bass and equalizer blessing And the FX settings of the club Thats it I will try another style song So be it Cant you keep watching me listening to songs You will be very happy after buying this back Because I tried so many headphones I chose this one in the end Think about the features I showed you Think again about Sennheisers sound effects Its a perfect match I forgot I was wearing headphones Maybe you find me watching Rip Van Winkle on the sofa my beard is all white and a few years have passed Dont think about it the conclusion is simple just buy this",

with Jims review room after reviewing these Sony WF 1000x truly wireless earphones they still havent fixed my syncing issue from the left to right your bud and after reading the comments from my fans out there theyre still having the same exact problem so I went ahead and moved on and bought these these are the Bose sound sport freeze theyre also truly wireless earphones and I personally paid for them I paid 250 at the time of this video as always I placed my affiliate links down in that video description below click on those links and theyll give you the most updated prices in real time youd never know when these things might go ahead sale so without further ado Im here to help you make that purchase decision welcome everyone to another review alright folks the sound sport freeze looks practically identical to this sound sports just without the wires in between now both sides are covered with a glossy plastic that fades from black to a deep golden brown or bronze its subtle but it surely makes the earphones look quite premium now on the sides theyre rubberized giving them a nice grip eNOS when youre pulling these in and out of your ears theyre also ipx4 rated meeting they can withstand water splashes and rain if youre caught out there and with our testing of splashing water on this the sound sports fries are still functioning perfectly fine now the sound sports are ultra comfortable because of the super stuff stay here plus ear tips now this has been bose is a unique design for a while now and it works for most people now Ill label them as being ultra comfortable because theyre not technically in ear earphones that means the ear tip doesnt go into your ear canal now this is perfect if you have sensitive ears and dont mind losing passive noise isolation now you do get the safety of hearing your environment while were walking or running on the opposite end though because theyre not blocking out noise again no passive noise isolation you do lose a little bit of audio immersion and at higher volumes they do sound leaked in good bits its a tradeoff that youll need to take into consideration now they did say my ear is quite well better than my jbird runs not the best is they do weigh a bit more than most of the competition out there it weighs in at 14 grams on each earbud per Bose but the flange ear tips again does very well preventing them from falling out the only issue and Im gonna put these in my ear here they stick out like a mofo when you look straight on now this is completely subjective but at least for me they do look a little too funky for my taste again thats up to you guys taking a closer look at these sounds port freeze boast skipped a power button on these earphones when you pull them from the case they automatically turn on for media and call control everything is on the right earphone bime up and down on either side and then theres in the middle a Bose multifunction button now with a single tap you can pause and play music with double and triple presses you can skip and go forward on songs holding it down for one second brings up either Siri or Google assistant now if a phone call it does come in you can press that multi and fun once again to answer it now we tested the phone call quality at the office and of course outdoors and they came across very clear and I was actually quite surprised at how good they were with most of the competitors Ive tested are the headphones and wired earphones and such they do pick up a good bit of background noise but the sound sport freeze did very well and kept a lot of the ambient noise around me to a minimum now on the left earphone there is one button here which allows you to quickly switch between up to seven devices yes and Ill repeat that again up to seven devices all at the same time now the only issue that I noticed the buns are quite hard to press here especially when you have it in your ears I can find them easily though but pressing them takes a lot more effort than the competitors out there firm presses are needed to adjust these things now finally included with the earphones is this exceptional case that I have right here its made of a durable matte black plastic and keeps the air phone safe now something thats really helpful and really cool that connecting pins are magnetic securing the earphones in place without any buttons or snaps it also helps align the ear buds here and most importantly less chance of them falling out of my case now the case itself also doubles as a charger providing two additional phone charges when the earphones are docked and pressing on the button to open the case also shows you five white LED indicator lights giving you an idea of how much better life is left on the earphones in or the case now Bose claims you can get up to five hours worth of use putting the sound support freeze at the top end of the competition matched only by the Apple earpods now in my battery test play music at 50 vibe from a full battery to dead the earphones made it 4 hours and 42 minutes with a 10 minutes low battery warning pretty darn good for lazier votes now they also offer quick charging within 15 minutes of charging this thing here it provides for 45 minutes of use to fully charge it it takes about two hours now Bluetooth range was also phenomenal with my iPhone and the office pixel except I found them to get around 68 to 72 linear feet of distance before cutting out and thats with a straight line of sight and last but at least finally I ran across some truly wireless earphones that has a fine my buds feature I know the Apple earpods has theirs but its rare that I run across truly wireless earphones that offers some peace of mind like this simply largely Bose connect tapi fine my buds tab and youll get a specific map pin to each ear phones last bluetooth paired location furthermore you can have them emit a highpitched tone so if theyre in the grass or just under your bed you hear exactly where they are thats a clarifying they dont have GPS so if theyve been moved you wont be able to see their current location since Im showing you the app some of the other features that you can adjust are an auto shutoff timer voice prompts and language studies other than that the Bose app is really plain Jane and doesnt offer much alright folks so lets move on to what might be the most important part of the review besides how it looks to me is the audio test let me start off by saying these sat flippin great here balance clarity and fidelity are the key words here a sound support frees provide a very high resolution sound thats also accurate to the music now these do get loud enough I found myself often listening to around 60 of Im but would sometimes bump it up to 75 to 80 during those really intense songs I listen to a DM and hip hop the classic rock and folk even retro wave and you guys got to get up on that they all sounded great shadows I would say that really shine were classic rock and pop music with these earphones now bass was president punchy for small earphones they didnt sound bass boosted like my jbird runs which Ill admit I do love I like some moderate bass my audio but for the boats it was just a cleaner sound it didnt sound synthetic theres no distortion its fullbodied and just enough for most generous of music to be enjoyed now if you ever listen to their boast QC 35 agency headphones its a very similar characteristic now the midrange is where the sound support fries really shines through the mid ranges when you hear most instruments like guitars strings and woodwinds as well as vocals resolution and detail was very very much apparent here all sounds were distinguishable and crisp without being recessed in electronic music those bright resonating notes that provide a feeling of energy and excitement are reproduced with fidelity and precision now vocals were pushed forward which I love and most of my viewers enjoyed as well allowing you to hear them clearly and with separation that moderate vibe detail and articulation filled out the higher frequencies here the treble were not sharp but gets to a point where you can appreciate the cymbal crashes to the higher pitch waydes on EDM and pop music at the higher volumes thats where you do lose a little bit of definition to prevent brass penis or ear singing but honestly overall they provided a fantastic audio experience without any listening fatigue I was able to wear these for an entire battery cycle with no problems now the last part here this is a unique situation the fans who have been farming for quite some time you guys know I love it wide an open sound stage with the sound sport freeze it does absolutely great with audio separation for Tomba left and right audio channels were tell about hearing vocals in the forefront so maybe some drums a little bit further back but the sound stage it is there but it isnt as wide as expected and heres the big but here the audio is perceived as though its coming from the center of your head yes right in the center here now it sounds crazy but its as though youre sitting written from the artist or maybe standing right in front of them theres concert speakers its a different level of immersion a different type of immersion thats not experienced too often play immersion or immersive experience nonetheless now I would say its something you got a trial test out your old earphones Ive been trying these and hear the difference again its quite unique now one last thing I know Sony was getting a lot of heat in my previous review one of the reasons was due to the WF 1000 Xs having a delay watching video it was the same here of the sound sports unfortunately theres a second or two delay when youre watching after speak to the time that you hear it in your earphones now this might be an issue across all truly wireless earphones because they have to sync with each other to play at the same time either or I just want to give you guys a heads up Im bat so overall the Bose sound support fries are a solid product they sounded phenomenal here and I cant stress that enough although they looked huge as crap in my ears right now but again looks are subjective but just to quickly end this video if they look good to you definitely give these a try but folks be sure to LIKE and subscribe to help support my work Im

"video_id": "eBQQa65X6F0", "Closed Captions": " what a great second day of spring its nice to stay in so let the gaming wireless headset battle begin hello good people Im Dimitri and if youve been considering getting a wireless headset you have come to the right place because behind me I have razor Logitech SteelSeries Corsair and HyperX so lets see which one is best right after this its always a pleasure upgrading or adding new hardware to your system especially when it comes to storage like this new OC ZTR 200 drive from Toshiba its a great value SSD offers a nice boost in performance for boot times file transfers and just general system and work operation with cuttingedge 3d flash memory and ultra reliable controller with builtin power management consider the upgrade today with TR 200 its available in different capacities check it out below this work see no wires its amazing oh alright guys so lets begin this ones gonna be one epic roundup if you want to check out individual views of the headsets that we have done reviews of theyll be linked in the description and also thats where youll find links to purchase any of these bad boys and to smooth out your viewing experience the timecode for this video will be pinned in the comments so lets go alright so lets start with the price under 100 we only have two pairs the Corsair Void Pro Wireless RGB and the Logitech G533 stepping up under 200 weve got the SteelSeries Arctis 7 the Logitech G933 the Razer man o war from 2016 and the new HyperX cloud flight is up here too at 159 and if youve got really big bucks to spend the Razer Thresher ultimate will shred your wallet for sure but not as much as the SteelSeries Arctis Pro Wireless with that a little bit of an insane 329 price now before we dive right in leave your predictions on lets say who will win the headset roundup in the comments below and then come back to it after youve seen the conclusion now I normally dont talk about packaging but of course the cult will appreciate the recognition plus theyre the only ones to have plastic covered the velvet material I do like Corsairs approach to simplified packaging and HyperX flight with all the cables right at the surface whereas a steel series buries all their accessories and tiny boxes and logitech is the only one to have their headset wrapped now the number of accessories kind of follows the price point they all charge via micro USB cable which is included with each headset along with some derivative of a USB dongle so either a thumb stick style or the extension style so you can expand your reach or close the distance between the headset now the Thresher ultimate comes with a hub since its a ps4 Edition so thats where you plug in the optical cable and charge the headset through the hub as well a plastic headphone stem is included with some clothes resemblance to this Imperial shuttle from Star Wars not sure if thats intentional or not while the most expensive pair the Arctis Pro Wireless has all the cables and double the batteries and the control hub thats also your receiver and a charging dock for the removable batteries so if you want a simplified wireless setup or are traveling want to minimize cable work all the pairs with the simple USB dongle would obviously be more convenient so like the void Pro the HyperX cloud flight both large tech pairs and the Razer Man o war that has a tiny receiver actually builtin into the ear cup while on the logitech g933 we actually have a specific compartment inside the ear cup to store the receiver but for those that do not have any compartments you can simply tuck it away inside the ear cup like this to safely keep the receiver with the headset now build quality varies between these headsets significantly and it doesnt necessarily follow the price point either the most robust pair is the still series arctas pro also being the most expensive with the quality metal headband aluminum hinges and everything just feels awesome the only problem is you cannot expand them because they rely on this self adjusting fabric piece and the same goes with the Arctis 7 but these have plastic hinges which are a little bit more loose and weirdly following after that would be the coarser void pro which happens to be also the cheapest pair they are nicely balanced weight wise metal hinges are not to lose and they feel like they can withstand some unnecessary force like if they drop from a table or you know if you flip them across the room the microphone though feels cheap you know the actual arm might lose resistance over time so thats the only negative I do like the lightweight nature of the HyperX flight the hinges feel fine but you have to be very careful with an allplastic body and that seems to be the compromise for these because theyre super lightweight so thats a positive and they kind of feel like that bose noisecanceling headphones too but when Im stretching out them on the sides the plastic stretches too so just have to be careful and be cautious of their built quality the logitech g933 comes next with the robust plastic body that does not creak all over the place the hinges are not too loose and the extension mechanism stays in place  theyre a little bit deceiving with this metallic surface but it does play on your perception of it feeling like a high quality build the Razer Thresher ultimate is quiet light thanks to the thin metal headband and plastic everything else the hinges worry me a little bit but they shouldnt have any issues with supporting the full weight of the headset the only thing that bothers me with the Thresher are the hinges and their corners are super sharp so if theyre around your neck they could cut you Northcutt true but scratch you and the same thing if like you put your finger there while youre taking them off its not a pleasant experience unfortunately the worst build quality goes to the Razer man o war they are bulky plasticy hinges are super loose and actually have a history of the middle headband piece breaking because its not well attached and also the Logitech G533 they just feel super cheap and the hinges have absolutely no control so the ear cups just wobble all the time and this headset has glossy sides if you like that dirty look and the only quality element is the expansion mechanism what this is going on right now now before we completely give up on headsets that have really subpar build quality I want to say that throughout my testing with these there is a balance between you know build quality sound quality comfort value features and so its kind of like a mixed bag there is no perfect headset in ass lineup and thats a bit unfortunate but just keep that in mind for later in the video and so now lets move on to comfort majority of these are awesome lightweight so you can wear them for hours until the battery dies and to no significant clamping force for any of these so my favorite would be the HyperX cloud flight with fantastic ear cup isolation extra interior padding and they also expand for larger heads no problem and fold on your neck in this nice low profile both logitech pairs have large and deep cushions awesome fit over all the G933 has smooth air padding all around while the newer G933 has this harsh bathing suit material that are super and pleasant on your skin both of them fold in your neck which are a little bit chunky on your ear cups but not uncomfortable seriously so this is the 533 hear how the sounds I could shower with this you know substitute my spongebob sponge sponge versus the 933 you may not hear the difference but I definitely feel difference the 933 is much smoother the 533 is way harsh like sandpaper on your skin which is super unpleasant by the way when its right by your ears now the void Pro has angular cushions so the cover my ears very well with nice pressure distribution to they fold in this non choking slim profile on your neck the round cushions on the Thresher ultimate are fine they are large and will cover your entire ear clamping force is pretty weak to avoid pressure buildup but heat concentration is present and despite being the largest headset in this round up default on my neck just fine without any mobility issues the menofwar headset has the same round ear cup design but a tighter fit and less comfortable headband with more pressure from the top and because they fold on this angle keeping them on your neck is really uncomfortable now the artist Pro Wireless comes with deeper cushions and slightly expanded headband versus the Arctis 7 but since theyre not really size adjustable it wont be comfortable for larger heads and both of them like to choke you when placed around your neck the Arctis 7 more so because of the tighter headband and so the 3 oddballs would be the 2 SteelSeries headsets and the razor Man O War something because the razor one has problems with the headband and its not really comfortable when theyre on your neck while the SteelSeries is perfectly fine for smaller heads you know theyre okay for me as well but I wish I had a little bit more expansion at the bottom so that I could bring them down a little bit more if Im wearing hat or something like that but because they choke you when theyre around your neck you know if you wear them around your neck and since theyre wireless  its kind of like a perfect thing to leave them on your body when even if youre not listening to something theres a little bit unfortunate with the SteelSeries Arctis Pro and the Arctis 7 the HyperX flight oh man what a comfortable design for on your neck just lovely moving on to features each headset has a power button and mic mute switch and the volume wheel and only the razor pairs the avoid Pro and the Arctis Pro have precise steps for volume all other have terrible control the G933 has three G keys for macros like changing your EQ settings lighting or whatever else and both SteelSeries pairs include a headphone share port which is quite unique the Arctis 7 has a dial for chat mix to balance voice versus ingame volume while the Arctis Pro is the only headset with dual wireless connectivity with bluetooth support so letting you connect this to your notebook or your smartphone without the need for a USB dongle now the hub with the Thresher ultimate is barebones in terms of control just the power button in the front and the Dolby surround sound that I dont understand why its hidden in the corner while the hub on the wireless pro lets you control your EQ mic side tone chatmix basically its a driver free experience that is appreciated and you have all this control even if you connect it to a ps4 alright so microphone test time so what youre hearing now is that from the Arctis Pro Wireless being the most expensive one how do you think that one sounds now its clean theres no noise when they stop speaking but the thing is it just sounds like theres way too much compression going on as it tries to cancel out whatever is in the background so next up is the cloud flight I think this one has really aggressive noise compression tries to just like really mute the background and that causes the voice to be muffled not the best sounding microphone in this collection and just like lacks definition and its not as sharp as the other pair that you just heard what youre hearing now is that from the Logitech G933 this is the oldest headset in this collection and I think it sounds the worst as well it just doesnt have much background compression or any focal compression it just like it picks up way too much ambient stuff and doesnt help to isolate just the voice and the voice doesnt sound that great either so um what are you gonna do luckily the new g5 33 definitely sounds much better it still exhibits a lot of background like noise and hiss despite the trying to cancel that out but the actual vocal range is much improved versus the older g933 the Corsair void Pro is next so this one has really aggressive noise compression and tries to like really cancel out anything so you will have these spikes in terms of volume in terms of your speech so if youre not speaking loud enough it will just completely cut that out so its not as powerful because it has that really aggressive noise cancellation the next one is the razor Man O War which is also one of the oldest ones in the surround of and it also sounds pretty bad you can see its very Boomy it doesnt have clarity in the voice and it does have really good like noise compression in terms of the background stuff but yeah it just in terms of the vocal pickup its not pleasant unfortunately the updated razor had said does not have any improvements in the microphone quality it still sounds very booming there is a you know aggressive background compression too but the vocal definition just completely is lacking in comparison to everything else in this roundup and finally the SteelSeries Arctis 7 its weird because they all sound the same in terms of how much compression there is for the vocals not just for the background and theres trying to compensate for that you know Im guessing for like the keyboard switches and typing stuff but it really destroys the any vocal definition and range that you might expect from an actually decent microphone like the microphone on the Sennheiser game one its been my goto headset for games because the microphone is just so good lots of body to the sound theres no that nasally compression that we hear on all other gaming headsets not just on this wireless stuff that were testing today but yeah this has been my definition of like a reference quality microphone on the gaming pair so let me know if you agree so based on that mic test which one sounded best to you I think the worst one would be the G933 which is also the oldest one the Razer pairs have that nice lower end boost which is booming well the rest of them can sound the same they all will kind of have this nasally compression going on in the background so Im not exactly sure which one wins so you let me know okay so in terms of sound performance they all deliver really powerful output in terms of volume so thats not really an issue but they do have pretty different sound characteristics so if youre looking for the best surround sound experience hands down either of the large stick pairs both create this large soundstage experience without compromising important details with incredible imaging I like feeling the audio cam like in front of you and not just in your headset and even in stereo mode you get amazing definition powerful bass control treble on both and its really unfortunate that the 533 is so flimsy because the sound and surround sound is just fantastic and adds extra points to this headset overall the next in the chain would be the HyperX cloud flight with a lot of definition precise bass heads and smooth treble and definitely one of the best within this roundup the Corsair voice Pro Wireless are satisfactory with balanced output its more closed off compared to the HyperX for example but with good detail presentation and bass thats there without overstepping its boundaries now the sound signatures between the SteelSeries headset is completely different they both have awesome detail and really tight bass but the Arctis 7 I prefer more because on the Arctis Pro while is the sound stage is slightly expanded and the treble is brighter which I prefer less and this the Arctis 7 is like overall a more fun signature for me both music and games and lastly that two razor pairs are the most powerful out of the bunch at 60 volume I was totally comfortable in terms of power output now the razor thresher has super harsh travel beyond 60 volume to the point of me needing to like lower it in order to hear anything and regardless of this upper boost it lacks midrange definition and bass has left the building  in comparison to everything else thats on the list while the men of war has a smoother treble and a more pleasant sound signature in comparison to the thresher but both these would be fantastic for FPS where you can hear every little detail and you dont care about the rest of the spectrum range you know where you want just the really sharpness to hear everything so perhaps for competitive stuff that would be fine but Im guessing everyone whos be spending money on the wireless gaming headset doesnt want to be just listening to FPS stuff but you want an allaround sound signature that would be compatible for both music movies and games and I would say the razer stuff isnt ready to par for that in terms of the wireless signal all of these in my space are perfectly fine i am able to walk around the space go six meters away with a few walls in between without losing a signal and without hearing any quality loss in audio so in terms of battery life I think the SteelSeries Arctis Pro takes the win easily because of these interchangeable batteries because one of them is constantly charging inside the doc so you just simply swap them out when one dies and you never have to plug it in to charge the headset versus all others need to be plugged in for charging whereas the large tech stuff I really appreciate the battery percentage indicator in the software so you know exactly how much juice you have left and you have to plug them in versus the rest of them in like the Corsair but the Corsair stuff would give you low medium or high in terms of battery life whereas the razor thresher has no software so you cannot even check the battery life everything else can last two days and then you have to be recharging and so depending on how much you use I think I would go for about maybe 10 hours of listening a day for most of these no problem and I would have to recharge it a little bit on the third day so that gives you a little bit of an indication on how often you need to recharge so maximum I would say 23 days unlike good heavy use with any of these but still the Arctis Pro because that removable battery easily wins the battery test alright people it is conclusion time and I will give you a few of my favorites first the HyperX cloud flights so theyre super comfortable I can wear them for hours they have amazing isolation and sound quality is incredible they are driverless so you dont have to think around stuff it just it is what it is but it is a bit expensive at the hundred sixty bucks so it slightly cheaper options where the cheapest option in this roundup would be the corsair void pro at 80 im overall impressed with this the only crappy thing is the boom arm for the microphone it feels kind of flimsy and cheap but in terms of comfort sound quality range and battery life really good stuff as long as it turned off the RGB youll be fine the game for at least two days but my surprising pick would be the oldest out of this bunch logitech g933 not exactly sure why large tech went ahead to replace the really good material that theyve had there with something that is from a bathing suit on the newer models but here the sound quality is incredible for Wireless and like really powerful not punchy but like really tight bass really good detail you know treble not too harsh the microphone quality on here is actually the worst out of the bunch but as long as my teammates can understand me Im fine and this is the only headset ever which Ive actually enjoyed surround sound with but its awesome and this would be like a really good dedicated gaming headset I definitely want to give SteelSeries a shout out with the Arctis 7 I think this is the better headset versus the Arctis Pro Wireless and if you guys want to see a complete head to head let me know in the comments below but this one sounds better to me and I dont really care so much about the the really big hub there with the interchangeable batteries so to me this would be a better value and its significantly cheaper the only thing is Steelseries have updated the padding and the actual headband on the pro to be a little bit more comfortable versus the Arctis 7 now in terms of the razor stuff its good to see theyve changed the design of the thresher to be a little bit more distant from the Man O War so its more durable but in terms of sound quality I feel like they went a little bit too much on the brightness like its a really sharp headset so if youre into that definitely check them out in terms of the fit its one of the better in this collection and the man o war surprisingly still sounds pretty good for being a 2016 release its only the the frame itself is really bad and you can up online as to why the top headband just keeps breaking because the design is not exactly the best but the raiser section here you know if you want to maintain loyal then the Razer thresher would be my recommendation alright guys so that is it for this epic roundup let me know which one of these you would pick if you are on the market for a wireless gaming headset in the comments below as always make sure to subscribe and follow us on social media check out this other relevant content and also dont forget to let me know which one of these sounded the best in the microphone quality because to me the kind of all sounded a little bit the same with one of them a little bit poor I cant think with so

years now and your trust to the old headset is getting a little tired Sounds like a perfect time to upgrade to a wireless gaming headset So today were taking a deep dive into five popular gaming headsets to see which ones worth your hard earned greenbacks This is a purse Colin this is a huge wallet The GeForce RTX 2070 Tri Frozer offers a triple fan thermal design eight gigs of GDDR6 memory and memory speeds of up to 14 gigabit per second Check it out at the link in the video description upbeat techno music Lets start with SteelSeries and the Arctis 7 For about 120 bucks on Amazon this is one of the more affordable headsets in the lineup today Out of the box it comes with your required charging and audio input cables as well as a remote receiver pod to increase your wireless range this thing The range on these things is the best of any of the headphones we tested in our lineup It made it way outside the building and nearly across the whole parking lot before dropping the signal Not bad On the back of this receiver there is both a line in and a line out You can use in for audio from a second source like your phone and out for your computer speakers which will automatically turn off when you turn on your wireless headphones So no more messing with the playback devices menu Huge win Moving onto the listening experience the Arctis 7s perform very okay Although theres a noticeable dropoff at the upper and lower ends of the frequency range Something thats easy enough to account for with the Steel Series Engine Software EQ For gaming the 71 virtualization is very good with clear directionality to enemy movements in game but as far chat is concerned well the microphone exists but its not gonna win any awards It does feature a nifty retraction mechanism though So thats nice I guess The headband offers a lot of adjustment but the pressure around the ears is a bit strong particularly for longer sessions Overall the Arctis 7s didnt impress us too much hot take But theyre definitely passable Moving on Feast your eyes on this the Corsair Virtuoso Wireless RGB RGB Theyre pretty expensive but they got the looks to match Check out the subtle RGB in the machine aluminium accents The big ear cuffs are comfy and actually didnt end up getting too hot during use which is something that occasionally can be a problem with leatherette cups Theres also a fully removable microphone A nice touch if you have a stand mounted microphone for streaming for example The range is reported to be 60 feet but our tests put it closer to 2025 feet which actually is the worst of the bunch but I am happy to see USBC making an appearance here In fact you may have noticed USBC making another appearance here at lttstorecom Okay as for gaming the Virtuoso RGBs have great imaging This makes it super easy to focus in on targets you hear However the sound profile is all over the place The bass drops off toward the end of the range but is weirdly jacked up in the low midrange So its really boomy out of the box However the Clear Chat EQ preset in the companion IQ software actually does a remarkable job of remedying this And with some additional tweaking we ended up really pleased with the headset as a whole Good job Corsair Maybe just throw a better tune on this thing out the box and yeah happiness Next up we have the most expensive headset in the lineup The Astro A50 The big appeal with the A50s is the fancy wireless charging cradledock ordeal Not only does it charging a snap literally theres also a huge array of IO on the back including optical But watch out because other than the microb charging port theres no IO on the headset at all So you cannot connect it to any other devices unless you use the dock That applies to wireless or wired Our A50s are PC and PS4 compatible and theres also a PCXbox version if thats your consol of choice As for how they sound though well look they sound good okay Quite good actually They have a nice clear response through the entire range particularly up top but they arent actually the best sounding headset in this list in our opinion And for the price these command thats a major sin in my eyes anyway This is really comfortable though I really really want to love them They are really comfortable Theyre easy to use day to day and the fact that theres an Xbox version is awesome You dont always see that By the way were working on a video where we check out all the different game streaming services that are coming out now like GeForce Now Project xCloud and PS Now so make sure youre subscribed so you dont miss out But for gaming specifically Im gonna have to recommend my next set of headphones incidentally from the parent company of Astro Logitech The Logitech G935s Lets get one thing out of the way here first The G935s from Logitech are not perfect The creak a little on the twist and theyre relatively big design may not be for everybody So why is this our favorite headset of the bunch Well theyre priced incredibly well Theyre comfortable with these big plush ear cups and they just sound fantastic The 50 mm drivers make their presence known with a full and deep low range while still doing pretty well up top with only a mild drop off in the very high end of the range and with a mild EQ tune up they sound just stellar with music When it comes to gaming however make sure to use the profile switching feature to enable surround sound The DTS codec and surround sound emulation do an incredible job imaging ingames Just be aware the processing affects music to a degree that is noticeable but as long as youre actually using the automatic switching youre good to go The Ghub software gives you a ton of options for programming the three G buttons on the back of the headset for lighting sound or IO presets and of course theres RGB Even though its all on the back of the headset where its not visible to your stream viewers or audience and if no one can see your RGB does it really exist Features like the tipup microphone mute are great to see as are the hidden dongle cowdy and user replaceable battery Finally we have the HyperX Cloud Flight Wow are these headphones over amplified The highs are way over modulated and so is the upper bass range with the noticeable dip in the mids and since the 270 megabyte software actually contains nothing useful the only way to make these sound better was to install Equalizer APO a free equalizer which actually got them to a totally reasonable level Very listenable that doesnt mean ill forgive the lack of effort HyperX put into the overall user and listening experience here though For a measly 94 relative to all the other ones in the group I can understand it but it feels like an incomplete product and our similarly priced other options here are just better buys Podium time our gold medal goes to these creaky Logitech G935s as the best value especially with a good EQ applied Speaking of equalizers if you click through to our forum post below all of the custom equalizer tunes Colin did to these headphones for this video will be posted for you guys to try out and if youve never equalized your levels before we say

description for more info again thanks to LastPass for sponsored this portion of the video so folks lets get into the list number 5 this is for all the people on a budget the Samsung Galaxy buds Ive tested a few months ago were very good for the price especially if you can get these for about 100 even again Ill leave my links down in the description for the most updated prices now these are the smallest and lightest truly wireless earphones Ive tested the Galaxy buds have up to six hours of better life which the industry is usually averaging around four to four and a half hours per charge and impaired in the connection for me Indies have been one of the fastest now Bluetooth 50 technology is offered and this is the latest version available as of this video with Bluetooth 50 you get stronger and further wireless signals with your phone now theres also wireless charging offered with the case and on the back of the case its the newest and latest USB see connections basically future proofing yourself is a huge thing right now now there is some water protection it is low though I will omit that it has a IP 2 rating youre only protected from dripping water and up to a 15 degree angle from vertical if youre caught in the rain with these it might be a little scary but to be fair if youre not running in the rain with these its like no big deal if you were one thing something more rugged keep watching this video the next one should be really good here but although the galaxy buds have bluetooth 50 getting back here if youre intending on watching videos with these for the most part they are in sync but on some few occasions theres about a millisecond delay there for those who dont know with some wireless devices youll see the lips move on video but then you hear the audio later and Ill be mention is quite a bit in the following models as well now also as a side note Samsung does have transparency mode pastor or some people call it ambient aware the microphones turns on and lets you hear your environment so its not just passive noise isolation perfect for safety and awareness around you but the Auto signature is good its very much suitable for the 100 price range youre not getting sonic fidelity but if youre looking for a casual yet quality pair the Samsung Galaxy buds offers tons of value lets take it up a notch here lets look at number 4 all right number 4 are the jbird run XTS Im really digging these things jbert had slightly redesigned these and they fit in the ears so much better than before now theres two flaws that Ive seen here one it has bluetooth 41 or 42 if I recall and because so for video the lips the actors voices again is out of sync but if youre focused on working not necessarily watching videos these things are rugged as heck and it might suit your needs but before I get to that the second flaw here is theres no passthrough so you cant hear your environment while running for safety and awareness but the following features this could basically offset those flaws there this has an IP seven rating meaning this can be submerged underwater not many competitors even offers that second the audio signature is very loud and alive here and with the free downloadable app you get punchy base if you want to punch up the low frequencies here if you want Ford highs or bright mids you can do that as well these are very responsive to get it the way that you want now better life on these are average with four hours per use and an additional eight hours from the charging case for a total of twelve hours worth of performance on the perks that helps the run XTS get on this list theres also location assistance if these drop out of ear lets say while running you can use their app to find them there are other brands that offers this feature as well but its rare and again the jaybird provides all those previously ever mentioned features and thats why I put them on a list as number four theyre super rugged it stays in your ears very well that bass boost is sound signature with that inyourface audio again folks Ill leave the links down in that video description but lets move on to number three here these are the Jabra elite 65 Ts the J birds are indeed nice but the Jabra does offer slightly better audio performance its airier its wider its simply cleaner there is an app that does allow Tooting as well its not as responsive as Jaybirds but Jarvis starts off with such a clean foundation any tuning just tweaks it just build upon it the elite 65 Ts is also one of the best fitting in ear performances here the J birds are good and do stay in but the elite 65 Ts feels more stable at least with my ears here theres always trying to recommend the best for you these are also Bluetooth 50 that means its a stronger more stable connection but with this Bluetooth 50 I didnt have any signal issues with video the better life is slightly above average with five hours per use with another 10 hours from the case for a total of 15 if you use these four phone calls the audio plays through both ears and it is superclear for the other person listening but keep in mind it does pick up a little bit of background noise or actually picks up a lot of background noise so just be aware of that now the elite 65 Ts offers an IP 5 rating for protection again jet sprays which again I think is enough for most people even at IP 4 rating is enough that it protects against water splashes now last there is here through which does allow you to pump in your environmental noises for safety and awareness and for being number 3 I think this is the best most wellrounded pair of truly wireless earphones out there but getting into the next two here Ill admit they are a little bit more expensive and honestly most people watching this video will probably buy either number five number four maybe Bs right here those are already great but these next two just take it up again one more  alright so I know there are some folks who dislike Beats products I can see where youre coming from in my beats headphone review specifically the studio threes they werent the best performance and they were charging a good bit as well but I have to give credit where credit is due and for the power beats Pro completely different product right here theres some features that is outstanding first and foremost this is the only major brand of truly wireless earphones that offers these ear hooks if you have slippage with other brands these ear hooks do work now Ive noticed time and time again Ive been reaching for the power beats pros over my other truly wireless earphones when I go to the gym specifically for the gym I use a different pair for everything else but talk about that pretty shortly here now when I lay down horizontally to benchpress who want to get on that treadmill and run for my life to the pulled days in the gym what have you the power beat pros stays on no questions asked now if you want peace of mind Im telling you these or it and I think they look really darn good two seconds these have had the most consistent fastest and easiest pairing that Ive experienced apples aged one ship thats inside offers that experience not only on Apple devices but also on Android its about a onesecond delay or one second slower on my pixel phone but still that consistency of taking out your earphones and then instantly pair into your phone every time with no issues its that was considered the best from my experience not only that because of this h1 chip the better life on these its possibly the best out there 9 hours will 9 hours of use plus 15 hours from the case for a total of 24 hours just the nine hours alone I wear them to the gym maybe forget that day to put them back into the case of recharge and use it the next day or tube and still have enough battery power to last I dont even think about it again intuitive peace of mind and practicality the numbers speak for themselves also testing this with video it works 100 fine with zero syncing delays we do have some water resistance and being upfront its equivalent to an IP four rating meaning they can only take on splashes they dont take on jet sprays like the IP 5 rating on the previous models and they cant be submerged like the IP 7 rating from jaybird but again ask yourself do you think youll be exposed to jet sprays or drop us into the puddle your call but the one thing that I know that would impact everyones the purchase decision here its not a bad thing but some people like this these are not 100 passive noise isolating earphones with all the previous models on the list they go in your ear canal and creates a seal and that helps tremendously with audio immersion and it does black out the outside world kind of like were in ear plugs then with the power beats pros you can hear your surroundings a bit somewhat some would like that for safety but again the other earphones do offer some sort of pass through or hear through connection that allows you to hear your environment as well yet you can always turn it off its actually a feature on there now with that being said the audio quality is focused on based focused consumers its deep its rumbling its gonna be loud and it is really nice though it is slightly niche Anish characteristic here that some would love but honestly and just being upfront some will actually hate because its so bassy I didnt mind it from my workouts it sounds good to me but surely not great this is just me I prefer the refinement of the job rows a bit more even the Jaybirds punchy bass I did prefer that better or more so but everything else about these earphones they hit it out of the ballpark and because of its ease of use and practicality thats why I can see many average consumers apprec the functions over the audio performance the audio is not bad at all but the other practicality functions here just basically supersedes that it just adds on to the experience so before I go into the best truly royalty earphones Basel met number one there are indeed some honorable mentions these are not bad but they simply didnt work as well for me I love these things here the Bose sound support phrase offers an insane audio experience somehow bose tuned these things to offer audio thats interpreted from coming within your head it sounds as though the center channel is originating from inside and not from left and right audio channels its insane and I still highly recommend for you to try them the only reason why I didnt place them on its list again this is just me you have to acknowledge they are huge also theyre heavy and didnt stay in my ears as well as I wanted them to and Ive seen some sixfoottwo dudes with a bigger head and such and it looks fine with them but me no I just didnt look right also they have barely any passive noise isolation as well very similar to the Apple earpods even less noise isolation than the power beats pros meaning you can hear everything around you you should still test them if you can now since mentioning the air pods I personally havent tested the new models but I am aware they dont offer passive noise isolation either thats what it might must have now Im sure theyre great I know their connection and better life is very good and for the price theres a lot of value with those two but again those just werent for me now the bnot 8 version 2 sounds amazing but not as good as my number one they look great that she charging is awesome but for 350 retail you get average better life thats four hours plus 12 hours with the case in addition you can only use the right ear but if you take any one of those earphones off and Ally this still has bluetooth 42 instead of the newest bluetooth 50 and with my testing I was able to prove it was only able to cover half of my apartment here well the all the other earphones on this list so far was able to cover at least 80 in some a hundred percent of the of the apartment here without the single crackling or basically breaking that with the clips t5 s and the creative outliers I havent tested them just yet if youre watching this in the future be sure to check back but just being transparent I havent had a chance to squeeze those in before this video Ive been delaying this video like crazy so with all that being said here who is the best here goes my number one pick for this year and it sounds freaking good its the Sennheiser momentum truly Wireless I know its expensive it retails for about three hundred and fifty dollars it is on sale for three hundred but freak man if youre looking for the best audio experience from a pair of truly wireless earphones these will put you in another dimension these are impeccable the bass resonates and its so clean it immerses you deeper into the beats the warmth is heard in the vocals to mid range thats very clean and clear to the high notes that really sparkles but what makes this sound better than any other pair of truly wireless earphones its the soundstage its super wide theres much depth in the audio interpretation even the average listener na audiophile can hear the audio separation to a great degree now there is an app to offer some tuning of the audio here and it does help not as robust as Jaybirds but again the starting foundation and these are very very strong defined tweaks helps supplement the experience now when Im not at the gym and when Im not using my headphones if I want minimalist around the office around the studio or walking outside to the grocery store over here to the bubble tea shops around here and the most important factor to me is the audio quality I use these basically this is what you also get Bluetooth 50 and with my testing both video on both Apple and Android devices it played perfectly in sync you have water resistance which is only at IP four which means its only splash proof but again thats all I personally need you get USB typec on the case here to feature proof these things are about 65 TS and Jabirs didnt have the latest connection that power B pros are on lightning and aside from my number 5 which with the Samsung Galaxy buds which were my budget models the BampO were the only other ones on my list so far that had USB typec you also have touch controls transparency mode and so you can use either earbud in your ear now the only thing that I didnt like is honestly the arent as stable as the more dedicated Fitness earphones but again these like the binos and Eclipse t5 and such they dont offer ear wings or ear findt they dont offer the best stability but again its fine because of everything else folks I love these Sennheiser truly Momentums so folks down in that comment section below let me know what you think of this list so far I know not ever gonna agree with it thats perfectly fine none of these earphones arent perfect and of course it still depends on how much youre willing to spend and of course what what youre gonna use it for but folks please comment down below like fire emojis of course and folks Ill catch you guys on the next one you guys take care bye Music", "video_title": "Top 5 BEST Truly Wireless

"b36aZQe0Nt4", "Closed Captions": " hey guys andru edwards here editorinchief of gearlivecom and today apple finally unleashed onto the world its new Apple earpods these are Apples wireless earbuds solution that was introduced back when the iPhone 7 was announced in September after a couple of delays theyre finally here and I want to give a big shout out to Apple by the way for hooking us up we got three pairs of ear pods here one of which were going to give away to one of you guys in a future video so be sure youre subscribed to find out about those future videos if you want to be first to find out when that giveaway drops just enable notifications after you subscribe but again that giveaway its coming in a future video for this video what I want to show you is how to set up the Apple earpods how to get them connected to your Apple devices now Apple talked about how simple that process was thanks to its new w1 chip so were going to test how easy that is in a minute but also they said if youre signed in through iCloud on that device if you pair these two youll automatically be signed in on all your other iCloud devices as well and thats definitely a big step up from how bluetooth pairing works right now so lets see how well that works inside the box youll find the charging case which is fairly reminiscent of a pack of dental floss and on the inside you have two of the air pods the case is what charges the air pods and you get 24 hours of charge from that case the air pods themselves get about three hours of battery life per charge and 15 minutes in the case brings it from empty back to 100 battery life to get these paired up all we need to do is make sure bluetooth is enabled on our devices and this will work with any device running iOS 10 as well as the Apple watch and Macs running Mac OS Sierra simply open the case and as you see its immediately recognized here on my iPhone 7 plus all I need to do is simply tap on the connect button and were done I can now use the air pods to listen to music and again since Im plugged into iCloud on my iPhone 7 plus and on my Apple watch and on my iPad and on my Mac I should theoretically be paired with all of these devices so lets see if thats true so heres my Apple watch Edition series 2 and lets see the air pods show up here as well and then this heres my iPad pro and as you can see the air files are paired here if I want to use them and lastly this is my macbook pro with touch bar and the air pods are paired here with the macbook as well so there you have it guys that was you look at setting up and pairing the new Apple earpods with your Apple devices it should be said that the air pods are standard Bluetooth devices so therefore you can pair them with other devices that arent Apple branded for example if you have a Windows laptop that has bluetooth you can pair them there as well as any Android phone that has bluetooth as well but now I want to hear from you guys let me know what you think of the air pods give me your impressions drop them in the comments below and Ill meet you there for further discussion be sure to hit that like button if you enjoyed this video and dont forget to click or tap on my face here in the video one that appears in order to get subscribed stay up to date on new future video releases and dont forget I do have an extra pair of ear pods here that were gonna be giving away so one of you guys so again be sure youre subscribed and enable notifications so that youre one of the first to find out when that giveaway goes live thanks so much for watching

annoying sometimes for the obvious reasons you have to charge them and take the time to pair them and all that but the one thing that Bluetooth headphones are really great for is working out they give you the freedom to move around the gym however you want to and you can just stuff your phone in a pocket and forget about it while youre out running and so for this this is my next were taking a look at bluetooth sport headphones now there are a lot of good Bluetooth sport headphones out there now so how do you even begin to choose which pair is right for you Ill say this its not necessarily about the purist or absolutely best audio quality yet when it comes to sport headphones these are going to get beat up theyre going to be tossed in a gym bag youre going to sweat on them so really what it comes down to is durability of course how well they fit can they hold a charge and okay sound after using more than a dozen different pairs of sport headphones Ive come up with two pairs that I think stand out my number one pick for Bluetooth sport headphones RJ Labs epic 2 Wireless sport earbuds J lab has made all the right moves with this pair of headphones from fit  sound  battery life  waterproofing these are sturdy but light with an adjustable cable and they come with eight different pairs of gel tips so they should fit a variety of ears they do require a little bit of adjustment because they go over the ear and then you have to twist them in but once theyre in there theyre in there and they sound great they offer deep bass with crisp clear vocals my only complaint would be that sometimes they sounded a little bit bright so Id end up turning the volume down like a lot of other Bluetooth headphones they pair with both iPhone and Android smartphones and they have a standard three button remote and mic attached to the cable they have a ridiculously long 12 hour battery life and they also come with an IP x5 waterproof rating now does this mean that you should go swimming with them no but Ive been sweating in them and have spilled water on them from my water bottle and the tap and theyre still fine these are perfect though the plastic earbuds themselves are actually pretty big and while I was able to find a comfortable fit eventually the sheer size of those might be an annoyance to some people now if you want to spend a little less money a close second or Plantronics backbeat fit bluetooth headphones what really sold me on these was comfort and convenience it just felt super comfortable to me they go over the ear like the jail abs for a more secure fit and this cables pretty thick but the best part about it is when you throw it in a bag it doesnt tangle the sound quality on these is pretty good its not super bass heavy but theres enough for beatdriven workout songs also the earbuds are designed to let some noise into the ear canal which some people prefer when theyre exercising outdoors and as an added bonus the backbeat fits come with a neoprene armband for your smartphone so why arent these my topic well the main reason is that the remote control technology is built into the earbuds themselves its not in a little remote that comes on the cable now in theory having interactive earbuds is not a bad idea but in this case with the Plantronics theres a learning curve and theyre also kind of sensitive so every time I went to Goa just the ear buds of my ears I would end up accidentally skipping or pausing a song I just kept wishing that it had a simple three button remote on the cable like the J labs there are a lot of other Bluetooth sport headphones to choose from and like I said this is going to come down to personal sound and fit preferences for you but there are some other things to consider that might be dealbreakers first do you really want to spend 150 to 200 dollars on a pair of headphones that are basically going to get beat up its kind of how I feel about the Beats powerbeats2 wireless headphones or the brand new jbird freedom sport headphones theyre both really nice and offer good sound but thats a lot of money to spend on sport headphones youll also want to determine whether you can deal with neck buds while youre working out like the kind on JBLs reflect response Bluetooth sport headphones some people find is really comfortable I find them to be a little doing especially when Im running there are also some sport headphones that require you to use a mobile app to experience the full benefits of headphones like Jabra sport pace or sport coach but personally last thing I want is to have to download another fitness app whether or not you want six hours of battery life or 12 a flexible cable or an unbending one interactive earbuds or a three button remote noise isolating buds or ambient noise and of course how well they actually fit you is really going to come down to you but you cant go wrong with jail abs epic  Wireless sport earbuds", "video_title": "The best wireless

subscribe button for tons more of the latest tech reviews roundups just like this and as always if you want the links to any of these products check the description below for all the links to all the products mentioned in this video ok lets jump right in so in no particular order lets start with the ultimate Apple earpods loans the i12 tws which you can pick up for just 33 pounds or 30 US dollars they look like air pods they feel like air pods they sound like well actually they sound very much like put your ear buds if Im honest but at this price its scary how much they genuinely nailed a replica of the airport experience apart from the packaging of course which looks like it was made by a sevenyearold kid on an inkjet printer but well let that slide for now so why on earth would you be interested in budget air pod clones well firstly that iconic Apple Airport design is pretty good and normally it comes with the associated premium price tag but here youre getting the exact same functionality and look for next to nothing and yes that includes the touch controls the pill shaped case with magnetic lid and magnetic snap for each airport it also charges through a lightning cable connection and has an incredibly simple pairing process  its all there plus you can easily fool people into thinking you have actual air pods if thats something that you wish to do of course without getting into too much detail theres actually very few ways you could tell them apart so Im gonna put the challenge to you guys heres real Apple earpods NYX  the i12 tws ill let you try and guess in the comments which is which i should probably also mention as well that the Bluetooth connection was rocksolid with these two the battery life is actually awesome at around 3 to 4 hours playback in one sitting with 55 milliamp hour batteries in each earbud and up to 15 hours extra if the 500 milliamp hour case is fully charged  so if youre craving the airport experience on a tight budget and youre not too fussed about the sound quality or youre just not a massive fan of ear buds that sit in your ear canal then the i12 tws are well worth considering next up are the rather futuristic looking Jay lamp Jay Bubs air at forty nine pounds or forty nine dollars and unlike the i12 tws these ear buds definitely deliver across the board and so they should really for an extra twenty bucks they may be the second most expensive ear buds on this list but what gives these ear buds an edge over cheaper alternatives is that it has three different EQ settings so they are jlabbe signature which is basically a bass and vocal boost a balance setting and a bass boost setting this gives these ear buds so much more versatility when it comes to finding a sound profile that better suits your own personal tastes of course the sound quality is great across all three different EQ settings  battery life is pretty awesome here  with a 500 milliamp hour charging case along with four hours of nonstop playback from a single charge thanks to the 60 milli amp hour battery in each earbud the charging case is really nice and secure but it is a little bit on the bulky side so heres the big question are the EQ settings and decent battery life worth dropping say an extra 20 bucks over cheap alternatives for me EQ settings like bass boost give the Jay pubs an edge over similar earbuds with an otherwise a very similar sound quality so I say the extra 20 bucks are well worth considering but hot maybe hold off just yet because as youll see in the rest of this video theres some very tempting alternatives for a lot less than 50 bucks so just wait and find out my third recommendation for the best budget true wireless earbuds are probably the best allrounder in this video the sound Petes true freeze or the duty of Zeus ace at 33 pounds or 33 dollars but wait why am i recommending two different ear buds at once well thats just because theyre basically both just rebranded versions of the exact same earbuds I know its very confusing but basically just by which everyone is cheaper at the time because they are literally the same product whats pretty mad though is that both of these earbuds dont sacrifice build quality or sound quality to reach that lower price point either the base on these is incredibly punching the mids and highs are well balanced and theyre definitely on par with the J bubs in terms of sound quality  the EQ settings of course everything about these earbuds feels like a premium product to be honest of at least 100 bucks and that is no joke the physical button controls on each year but are brilliant theyre super responsive to a light click and each earbud is actually smaller than the J bubs  unbelievably these earbuds now also have an eight hundred million power capacity charging case thats something crazy you like an extra 35 hours of listening on top of the three to four hours youll get from a single charge the microphone for calls is crystal clear and the case itself is pretty light in compact  but 33 bucks these earbuds are just insane value for money and take pretty much every box you could possibly want out of true was earbuds on a budget its because of these earbuds that Im very reluctant to drop 200 bucks on premium true wireless earbuds next up are the anchor sound called Liberty air earbuds at 80 pounds or 80 US dollars whilst theyre actually the most expensive on this list anchor are aiming to give you an airport like experience at half the price of actual air pods which is great and it sounds great but maybe it would be slightly more appealing at the i12 tws 130 dollars just saying it but in all fairness the Liberty airs are a million times more of a polished product than the i12 tws which is no surprise considering the anchor a brand that I recognize and I can always trust when it comes to tech the sound quality is a huge improvement over the i12 tws though it isnt actually the best compared to say the sound piece true freeze or the duty Oz news ace I found that the Liberty airs surprisingly like a lot of bass and at this price point Id expect clear margins of improvement over a 33 pair of earbuds but in every other way they just pushed the boundaries of build quality and functionality at this price point the touch controls are intuitive and easy to use to build quality isnt that far off actual air pods yes really and the battery life is great with a 55 an power battery in each earbud and a 500 milliamp hour charging case the microphone is also probably one of the best for voice calls out of any of the earbuds in this list but its still a hard sell if the Liberty Ayres were a little bit more affordable theyd probably be my personal favorites as I find that they fit my ear much better than the J buds or sound peep style design theyre secure comfortable and its easy to forget theyre even there at a lower price point I kind of be able to forgive the sound quality a little bit more but Im afraid for 80 bucks Im just expecting better than average sound quality last but by no means least are a very familiar looking pair of ear buds the sound Petes Q thirty twos at forty pound or 40 US dollars it doesnt appear to be an equivalent duty or Zeus equivalent at the moment but as soon as one emerges Ill keep the links in the description updated accordingly but why am i showing you what looks like the exact same ear buds again at seven bucks extra well yeah theyre the exact same ear buds but its its the case here that gets a pretty sick upgrade the regular sound Petes true free ear buds ship with an 800 milliamp power case which is pretty crazy but the Q 32 2600 milliamp power case thats a mindblowing 55 hour playtime if your case is fully charged at least and for seven bucks extra I mean its crazy how the worlds offbudget true wireless earbuds has become so awesome for so little granted it makes the case pretty chunky but lets be real if you do go on super long journeys were charging isnt always possible or you just always forget to charge to them and they constantly fly and you cant use them just take the chunkier case on the chin pay the seven bucks and be done with it you wont regret it youll find it very useful as Im more of a casual earbud user Im sticking with the true free 800000000 power case because thats still a heck of a lot of charging power and I appreciate the case of slimmer profile for when I just want to shove it in my pocket but still I love these earbuds overall so much they had to throw in this minor upgrade which makes a big difference in terms of battery life so thats it for the five best true wireless earbuds did I miss any out have you tried any of the earbuds in this video how they what are you gonna buy

102244970955", "video_id": "OhDk5A0PhuQ", "Closed Captions": " so these are the a th m50x from Audio Technica a cult favorite that then became one of the bestsellers one of the most popular headphones on all of Amazon okay fine so its a great headphone its a popular headphone why are you talking about it right now Lou whats happening what has developed something very exciting in fact so many of you have gone out and bought this headphone but youve been stuck youre sitting at home with the wired connection or you have the wire heading out from this port here to your mobile device or wherever it is that your audio source lives but today I got this product over here from a company called East Brooklyn labs the be Al  m50x this is a Bluetooth adapter specifically for the m50x this little guy will plug in to where your cord normally would plug in and you will pair up to the adapter its modular its beautiful now this isnt the first solution I have found for taking a wired headphone and making it Wireless there in fact other ways to do that as well from various brands so heres an adapter from a company called air mod and theyre focusing on the Bose products so the qc25 in the QC 15 here are a couple products to turn those headphones into Wireless and they fit in there perfectly as well and then weve got this company here EXO audio they make similar adapters but for Beats headphones so heres one for the bead studio up heres one for the beats solo2 and then the last one is this one here its called air link now to me these are the two most exciting why because Ive got some m50x already and because the air link takes any headphone and makes it Wireless so this little guy this little module would you look at that how pretty is that little thing so this will clip on to your shirt your sweater pocket coat something like that and not only does it give you control over volume your microphone for answering phone calls and even what looks like a shutter button for a camera right there this Clips here the earpods go up and into your ears and now youre not tethered to your pocket now I know before you say it I know what you want to say you want to say but thats not actually Wireless because theres a wire going to this module but it is a more convenient than having the wire go all the way down to the pocket so with a product like this youre able to shorten the distance from the cord to your ears okay so thats cool the air link the other adapters that I mentioned earlier exciting stuff if you have one of those pairs of headphones or if you want the universal one but the one that Im most pumped up for is this one here from East Brooklyn labs because like I said the iconic m50x now gets the Bluetooth treatment it now turns into a bluetooth headphone and best of both worlds here you can still use it with a wire if you want to so lets crack this open see what its all about so it has a similar shape to those beats adapters that I showed you earlier also in the package is a tiny little micro USB cable to keep this thing charged up and then the adapter itself its got a matte finish on it which I like so it shouldnt get too many fingerprints your power switch is over here and lets see how it fits in so this is the design of the m50x if youve never seen it it has this channel which moves down a little bit oh you might be wondering as well Lou whats up with your m50x why you have the cool color on there so this is a D brand skin actually allowing you to customize the look of the m50x I told you its that popular they even made a skin for this how many people have this headphone and worth mentioning before I insert this the m50x doesnt allow for a 35 millimeter connection on the headphone side its actually smaller its 25 millimeter right there okay so lets go ahead and check out this fit here ooh I like that so the way that theyve built this this is cool design here this section of the headphone sinks into this section of the adapter right here so it doesnt hang down too low its not its not much of an obstruction at all in fact it only increases the length of the ear cup by not even half an inch and thats what it looks like when youre wearing it so well here I mean its really not a big deal it has hardly any weight to it and all of a sudden my favorite headphones are now Wireless I mean thats cool so there you can see see that little blue light it might be tough to see because its lit up in here but the blue light starts flashing immediately when you have the power switch flipped on I mentioned that this charges up over microUSB and then on the front you have your controls the Bluetooth button volume up and down I think its impairing mode and immediately though because it is flashing blue right now see that there so lets check if its available m50x bao m50x now Im gonna put these on and lets see how this sounds through the adapter so as far as the button in the middle goes I think you might hold it to reestablish a Bluetooth connection but if you tap it it pauses what youre listening to so you could have a conversation and tap it again and then it picks up again theyve done a serious job here I am beyond impressed that is a package the m50x is already a great headphone one of the minor drawbacks you cant use it wirelessly now you can without giving up the wired capabilities the sound quality though is probably the most impressive part lots of juice which I didnt expect on a large  ear headphone and just overall punchy it sounds good I would recommend this if you have an m50x or youre thinking of getting an m50x this is probably the best companion piece that you could add to it Ill link it down below in the description theyve done a great job just remember this isnt your only Avenue as I mentioned earlier in the video there are solutions to essentially turn any wired headphone into a wireless headphone including earbuds and so on with the universal adapter I showed you called the air link and then of course separate products for the beats headphones and the Bose headphones I just think this is probably my favorite of the bunch so check these guys out oh and also worth mentioning the company that makes this adapt their East Brooklyn labs theyre claiming a 5 hour runtime so 5 hours of listening on a single charge and I also just noticed not only is it available on Amazon but you can get it bundled so you get the headphones and the adapter all in one package either way Ill link it down below you", "video_title": "You Can Make Your Wired Headphones Wireless",

"video_id": "9OwvwqvjPjQ", "Closed Captions": " whats up guys Lew here back with another video but before we get into it I want to give a quick shout out to another video that I did on tides channel they asked me to mess up one of my favorite garments yes one of my favorite hoodies I put a couple of different sauces on there and chocolate ice cream and the challenge was to see if theyre tide pod product could actually get those stains out so I could keep wearing it and looking pretty for you here on unbox therapy so go check out the video theres a link in the description probably an annotation as well show some unbox therapy love for tide because everybody needs to have some clean clothes get yourself cleaned up a little bit easier for mr Jack isnt it isnt it whats up guys Lew here back with another video and today weve got some headphones you guys know that I love headphones these ones are special theyve been looking for so long for the perfect set of wireless headphones to have at my desk for convenience bars wireless headphones go these are some of the best that exists as far as I know because they use uncompressed wireless digital frequency response transmission that sounds pretty complicated theres no compression thats applied to the sound like in bluetooth its using its own RF frequency so essentially the idea here is the highest quality sound without wires it also has this really cool base station that charges the headphones giving them up to 18 hours of battery life these are one of the reasons that Ive been holding off on episode 3 of my desk tour because I wanted to make sure these got on that desk before I did it theyre not cheap then again a lot of things here on unbox therapy arent but as many things in life follow this rule you get what you pay for right right Jack alright pop these babies open accessories the actual RS 185 oh yes nice and light surprisingly light when it comes to fit on a pair of headphones its as important in my opinion is sound wheres my phone going off hello hey Im in the middle of making a video like actually recording right now you I think you just made it in the video yeah yeah youre a big star now okay say hi to the world real quick Im gonna put you on speaker really you do okay but this is the base station this can sit on your desk look at that essentially act not only as a charging stand but a stand for your headphone so here we can display them charge them at the same time as well as have all of our controls so we have volume on the front a level button for alc or MLC and then at the top there is a battery indicator on the back here is all of your io you have a digital optical in so yes this can take a digital signal and then you have an analog one if youre going lowtech oldschool not that theres a problem with that and then a power as well and here is your selector for whichever audio input youre using on the top is the charging section those little pins will charge up your headphones and that pretty much rounds out the transmitter the accessories some paperwork when I was young I used to go to bed with the manuals from the latest gadgets that I had purchased and when I say go to bed I mean go to bed okay think about that a bunch of powered app theres North America Europe somebody told me what this one was recently New Zealand Australia AJ perfect booyah ready for power so here we have an RCA style cable for an analogue input an optical cable for digital audio and batteries so theres a couple of little tabs here telling me to twist the ear pad and that exposes the battery section one battery two batteries Vellore style or microfiber style ear cups super comfy for me they dont get as hot on the side here is where youre going to control everything here you can see you can control level left and right and volume as well now these are an open back style Sennheiser does make closed back wireless headphones as well okay so now I have these hooked up to an audio source youre probably going to have these in an entertainment unit or hooked up to your computer permanently now I noticed a couple things on the front here this level button controls the ALC or MLC so thats the automatic level control or manual then you have a knob here for controlling the input level so lets go ahead and start up some music so you dont want to overload this manual control so if I go to automatic level control so it sort of finds the right level and then I suppose youre going to control the volume here on the headphones so the the ALC is working perfectly right now its not clipping at all as you can tell sound is bleeding here like crazy but thats the intent with an open back design if youre concerned with like disturbing people in your directive vicinity if people are sitting in the same room as you like in an office type environment that might be an issue but if youre in an office where people cant get down with instrumentals like this you probably dont want to be there anyways Im going to turn it up now so if you overload the manual control youll actually get a red light indicator so thats really cool so you can kind of fine tune it okay so were working with plenty of volume there plenty you can really blast these things if you want to Im gonna go ahead and try them with a number of different sources and if you guys have any more questions about them I will be using them on the daily so hit me up on Twitter Im at unbox therapy you can ask me questions there so far very comfy and the sound is well impressive once again if youre interested in pricing and availability the links will be down in the description these are about to find a new home on my desk and they gonna look pretty damn pretty over there if you enjoyed this content make sure to leave a thumbs up down below thanks as always for watching and Ill catch you on the next episode later youre probably so cool that you listen to bands that dont even exist yet thats as cool as it

actually route it in your space and some headphones even have the dual wire coming out of each ear cup which is not that pleasant when youre trying to take them off and it just becomes you know you have to deal with the wire any way you slice it unless youve got a wireless pair that gives you that convenience or freedom of movement not worrying about the cable around your body you still have to position something around your computers for the wireless receiver for the headset but how does the artists 7 play out in this whole Wireless Arena lets check it out right after this hi Im looking for a case well look no further I got this beauty the H 700 I buy NZXT with all steel premium frame with a side of tempered glass  beautifully showcase any cooling adventure you might pursue and came a management system that you wish you had earlier all this lit up with integrated RGB lighting and builtin fan control the aged 700 I this ones for you oh Ill take it alright so the arcus 7 from a feature standpoint is one of the best wireless headsets around that this priced inline with competition from Logitech and Razer although the new Void pro from Corsair is 50 bucks cheaper so if the lack of cable is a priority for you that is an option you can check out the full view right here as expected the entire arc this family is diverse from standard analog pairs to bluetooth to USB RGB headsets and its a really nice surprise to not see RGB on this wireless pair to preserve battery life the overall structure is fine with plastic ear cups with pleasant rubber coating the top headband is metal unlike the plastic construction on all other arctas pairs the swivel joints are a little bit too loose for my taste but notice there is no creaking so thats awesome the self adjusting fabric is swappable and stretches a little bit and its a cool customization element definitely more unique than RGB lighting and the earcup cushions are nice to the touch with a soft Center but I find them not thick enough to compensate for the convex plastic housing of the driver that I can feel with my ears so the arcus 7 is slightly heavier than the nonwireless arctas 5 in Arcis 3 because there is a battery in here and our other wireless components but unfortunately SteelSeries have not done any structural changes to accommodate for better comfort I find this allinone fits all type of headband that stretches based on your head size not ideal because Id say I have a mediumsized head with a lot of hair so Im already touching the bottom of that metal headband which has very little padding this will be an issue for people with larger heads because we do have width adjustment which is fine but not much height adjustment and therefore even though the clamping force is nicely balanced for example I can feel the top of the headband but the headset is being sort of supported by the ear cups on each side and because we cannot extend the headband leaving the headset around your neck is uncomfortably tight its just better to take them off when not in use the microphone is retractable that has less than usual flexibility so it stays in one position every time you pull it out it is always on unless muted with a switch at the back that you can easily find and the red LED is easy to notice when its muted dont believe all the marketing hype that you see especially with SteelSeries claiming this is the best microphone in gaming so its clear and its detailed its got some nasally elements to it in terms of Brac on compression right now Im typing on an MX blue keyboard which is right below me and you can still pick up those keystrokes although they are muted but in terms of comparing this microphone to other mics its clear and its not as nasally as the Void Pro Wireless and what youre hearing now is the coarser void Pro Wireless so this one is a bit quieter its not as detailed it doesnt have as much of a lower end bass pickup and I think this one sounds a bit more nasally and what youll listen to now is the Sun Heiser game one my far my favorite gaming headset microphone its rich its detailed and you guys can compare to what it sounds like you know wired versus Wireless in this price range there are many controls on the headset starting with the power button then a dial for chat mix that lets you balance your voice comms or ingame volume with a tactile middle bump the battery indicator is the blinking color of the power button or the 4bar battery icon in the software and I think just a simple percentage of the battery number would have been better on the other side is the mic mute a smooth volume dial from zero to a hundred a USB minib eight pin cable and a 35 millimeter input for audio sharing and the micro USB for charging so this micro USB port is only for charging and firmware updates it does not work without the wireless receiver but you can plug in the USB minib Aitken cable that ends with a 4pole 35 millimeter jack so the headset can be used with mobile devices or a controller without the need to power it on now the wireless receiver is a bit different than usual its a compact hub with the white LED at the front if solid the connection is fine and if blinking the headset is either sleeping or disconnected theres a pair button on the side and on the back theres the line in and out which is pretty cool because you can route your speakers into the hub and have it automatically switch between the headset if its on or the speakers if the headset is off and put the line in you can connect whatever source that has a 35 millimeter output into the hub that will then wirelessly transmit audio into your headsets for for example if you want to play audio from your smart phone from the hub or like Nintendo switch that does not support USB audio but you can route that analog signal into the hub that will then go here or maybe from TV so that you get that Wireless convenience without having to actually connect the headset directly into your source now I was actually quite surprised with a plugandplay setup process I already have the Engine 3 installed on my computer and that recognizes the headset immediately but both the firmware and additional drivers have to be downloaded which is automatic for it to work properly now I normally never touch anything in the settings but I do like to hear the mic side tone so I put that on high and some EQ adjustments are always nice for a competitive game play the dynamic range compression is unnecessary and just sounds horrible if you want to hear everything on a uniform decibel level just use the volume wheel to adjust your volume and as far as the surround sound experience with DTS X as usual its quite bad it expands the soundstage but you lose directional cues that theyre otherwise audible and stare and many important audio elements are now muffled so the only advantage with surround sound on is a slightly larger immersion of you audio environment as with stereo things are a bit closer to you and closed off in this headset but the stereo mode is actually quite nice with lots of detail on the high end I prefer a brighter sound signature for competitive gameplay because you pick up all the trouble and all the little things that make you aware of your surroundings and where things are coming from the midrange is great and the bass is weak which I actually prefer for a competitor gameplay and the wireless signal is actually quite impressive not only in the range Department I got about six meters with a few walls in between without losing signal but in terms of clarity and not hearing any distortions or any background hiss or noise and stuff like that its completely fine very good signal in the wireless department so its actually quite nice if you like to listen to music podcast or whatever else while being mobile around your house thats for battery life its nothing about standing still series claims 24 hours of listening time I got about 20 hours of continuous use before the red blinking LED start to go off and the convenience of microUSB for charging is good because many mobile devices utilize micro USB so charging this thing should not be an issue I still wish that we have the percentage of battery left in a software so that you could be a little bit more clear on how much is left and the headset does shut off by itself to preserve battery life when not in use but unfortunately I found that I have to power it on manually every morning after the computer has been shut down and I wish that it would automatically get that connection through the hub when its on and power on the headset as well so that I dont have to manually do it every single morning and so the arctas 7 is fully loaded from a feature standpoint as far as wireless headsets go this is not the best mic in gaming but its pretty fantastic with awesome stereo drivers but I wish the headband structure was taller for extra comfort I wish the dials in the back were not as loose because anytime I put the headset on off I constantly switched something either the volume or the chat mix and I wish that the connection between the headset and the hub was a bit more automatic and pick up the signal right away when the the hub is on so I dont have to do it manually all the time now the main thing here is that Wireless convenience

promising sound  __  awesome this video is brought to you guys by huni huni is the free web browser extension that will help you find the best promo codes on shopping websites like Amazon eBay and more get it today join honey calm l tt to understand this product I feel like we have to go back in time a little bit mass drop now drop comm partnered with thx on a desktop headphone amplifier back in 2018 and they got extraordinarily positive reviews with people calling it the last amplifier youll ever need and Im not talking just the audiophile community that buys snake oil 200 cables Im talking the analytical ones like a mere m the founder of audio science review and the special sauce was apparently in the THX a chromatic audio amplifier or triplea achromatic is basically a 10 word that means lacking in color so the name means that the amplifier was designed to not color the sound like for example a tube amplifier would which would give your music like a warmer sound basically whatever goes in is exactly the same as what comes out just louder thing is that amp would have been too power hungry for a portable device thats battery powered like this one so were actually looking at a new member of the family today the mobile optimized thx triple 80 the physical design of the headphones is outstanding but only in the sense that its trying so hard not to stand out like honestly these remind me more of like a reference design that might be created by a technology company to demo it to new partners who are going to run out and create their own designs I think they ended up with something thats a little bit too plain for the Zoomers out there but theres also an old excuse me more mature audience that might prefer this kind of a black everywhere look beer cups really comfortable I found the clamping pressure was a nice middle ground between ones that kind of grab onto your head like a vise taking all the pressure off the headband and ones that rely on the headband to support them and they just kind of float over your ears the io and buttons are really simple so youve got this fourway rocker joystick here that handles volume up and down track skip this way and then start and stop just by pressing and then you hold it for actually really long five seconds in order to get them to power up or power off it charges via USB see in terms of battery life I ended up getting about five hours of playback and I dropped 20 of the battery in the short time that Ive had these and then microphone wise youve got a couple of microphones built into the right ear Cup with noise cancellation I mean they dont sound amazing to me but theyre definitely serviceable on the left ear cup you get a whole lot of not much so its a three and a half millimeter jack that serves two purposes theres an addon boom microphone if you want a game on these I cant speak to how well that works I dont have it and then you can also just plug a threeandahalf millimeter cable into your device if youre still using something with a threeandahalf millimeter jack on it now to me the amplified sound that is when youre running off batteries wirelessly and the wired sound were exactly the same and I was half expecting the Golden Ears out there to tell me that I was flat out wrong but then actually read a blog post from drop com later where they confirmed that that was something that they actually tuned these for so thats pretty nice one complaint I have here is the headband the adjustments are pretty granular theyve got a nice satisfying click to them but theres not a lot of adjustability in it and the headband itself has almost no padding on it whatsoever so theyre just kind of relying on that clamping force and I did find that unless I was wearing it at exactly the right spot so that it sits flat on my head like I prefer to have my headphones a little bit farther back and I found it kind of Duggan wasnt as comfortable as it could be this is something that I wish theyd fix in a v2 with just a little bit of cushion because everything else about these is kind of incredible no matter what kind of music I throw at them whether its the soundstage and stereo separation which is outstanding the the bass response its like oh man I hate to say that theyre super analytical and flat because theyre not like when the song calls for it they punch really hard but you get no muddiness whatsoever and one of the other issues that I tend to run into with more you know reference or you know analytical flat sounding audio products is that I can find them quite fatiguing I find really sparkly highs are hard on my ears after it even as little as 10 or 15 minutes but with these I am comfortable saying that these are gonna be the most audiophile pleasing wireless headphones out there and not just compared to your consumer brands like your skull candy or whatever else Im talking compared to someone like a sennheiser who I feel has over the years made a lot of compromises to their wireless products in order to be more of a lifestyle brand rather than being true to their pure audiophile roots this is just no compromise of course thats my initial impressions I would be remiss if I didnt actually compare them to other products theyre gonna be competing with in the marketplace so what Ive got here is the Bose QuietComfort 35 twos as well as a pair of Sonys WH 1000 XM threes these are both very wellregarded wireless headphones but ones that take as were gonna see a very different philosophical approach to their design man I cant even I cant even talk while Im listening these theyre like so sound isolating too which is weird because they dont have any active noisecancelling whatsoever after trying the abyss headphones honestly I didnt expect to be surprised like that again by a headphone at least not this soon but at the price these are at with Wireless this is incredible you really should try them like anyway lets lets get these other headphones paired up here Im gonna start with the QC 35  since they came away the clear winners in our last roundup immediately the active noise cancellation is nice but actually Brandon can you just kind of talk at me for a sec yeah okay shockingly especially for discrete sort of sudden noises like a person talking they dont actually block that much more sound though I would expect them to do a lot better for like a constant drone like the rumble of an aircraft the Bose sound is still good and its still to my liking I like the tuning on the QC 35 twos but it has kind of like a a hollowness and its not not even close theres a lot of muddiness in the base thats masking other details that youd otherwise be able to hear on something more analytical and when you go loud theyre messy I mean you should never be listening that loud but the truth is some people do and if you do they dont hold up lets try this on these NFC pairing is pretty neat hey Brandon I was just I just wanted to hear how much I could hear you a little bit less hiss a little bit less of the pressure feeling than both as the volume goes up the bass gets really loose one thing youre always gonna have to deal with with active noisecancelling though is theres kind of like this baseline kind of something even if its not quite noise like that pressure Sony and both though do a fairly excellent job of minimizing it after listening to the Sonys for a while longer Im having a hard time remembering what I liked so much about the QC 35 is to be honest with you lets go back to the pandas man that power on sound is cheesy Oh Im even more impressed like by a long shot Im Way more impressed now than I was even when I first put them on sorry hold on hold on hold on let me turn this up okay go ahead they are they are actually so much better now with fresh context that I feel like I wasnt positive enough in the earlier part of the video so I guess this is the part where we talk about the tech that they built into these then so theyre using drops planar ribbon drivers that are derived from the Oppo digitals PM series theyre using the QC 5125 bluetooth chipset that has support for LD ace although it should be noted that youll need to manually enable this higher quality mode on your device and frankly speaking I didnt hear much of a difference coming from app decks so your mileage may vary there but this is a big deal to me theres no DSP in these things whatsoever so you cant set them to auditorium mode or anything like that but they sound absolutely great without any digital tinkering and if you really like that stuff theres apps that you can get for your phone to do it with all that set the real test for me believe it or not is against the air pods Pro thats my daily driver right now and I know that the air pods pros have a lot of compromises theyre not a perfect experience on Android they are not by any means the best sounding earphones on the market but the form factor they can literally fit with their entire charging case inside one of these plush ear cups here there is something to be said for that I love these things these have been a game changer for me I actually even sleep with them in because the active noisecancelling helps me fall asleep all right they already sound like hollow and empty that really is kind of air pods in a nutshell isnt it you dont know what youre missing because thats all youve ever known realistically Im still gonna daily drive these Im just gonna be a lot more disappointed in them moving forward but I also want to clarify that these arent gonna be for everybody because up until this point wireless headphones have really differentiated based on features as opposed to just audio quality like I remember the parrot zieks with their touch sensitive swiping controls and theres Microsoft but their fancy dial and you know theres well Sony in Bose with their builtin assistant buttons and theyre you know active noisecancelling all that kind of stuff but by contrast these are four hundred US dollars they have no phone app no touch sensitive buttons no active noisecancelling no transparency mode so they actually lack a lot of the modern creature comforts that weve come to expect you know no there isnt even a digital assistant summon button and this was something that I forgot I even cared about but they dont automatically pause when I take them off they just keep playing around my neck its like oh oh yeah that was the thing a long time ago but I think from a certain point of view thats the point of these things theyre as close to the experience of wired headphones as you can get in terms of the sound quality in terms of just not having a bunch of digital crap in them other than the amplifier that they need and I like I really like them now one thing I want to address is that master op is sorry excuse me drop com a regular sponsor of ours but the only reason I checked these out was because I was genuinely interested in them and they did not sponsor any aspect of this video whatsoever who did though how do you like that Segway is ring so thanks to ring for sponsoring todays video ring is on a mission to make neighborhoods safer you can create custom affordable security with their smart home cameras and doorbells and personally for me its all about the creature comforts keeping the delivery driver around a little bit longer telling the neighbor kid hey its unlock just come on in the kids are playing in the back room or whatever and not having to actually go to the front door is freaking sick the ring welcome kit includes the video doorbell  and chime Pro the video doorbell  has a motion sensing camera with adjustable range its 1080p its got 160 degrees of vision and its got twoway audio builtin its battery or eight to 24 volt AC doorbell wiring powered so you dont have to worry about you know just having being stuck with just one option and the time pro not only lets you know when someone pushes your doorbell of a nice loud ring it extends your WiFi signal  which is useful for getting WiFi to all of your smart home devices and also just extending your range and having fewer dead zones so get some peace of mind with the ring Welcome kit its compatible with iOS Android Mac and Windows check it out at ring comm slash LTT were gonna have that linked below wireless headphones

premium dollar bows or Sennheiser lets find out shall we intel skull Canyon Nook features a 6th generation Core i7 processor and Thunderbolt 3 you can learn more at the link in the video description ok so theres a lot to cover here were going to jump right into this both headphones fold in to an included carrying case but Bose wins quite decisively here the QC 35 s case is both smaller and more durable feeling than Sennheisers offering onto the contents being headphones and ones designed to fit on the heads of humans the QC 35 and px II 550 are pretty darn similar in many respects headband ear cups laserguided artillery launcher etc so Ill try and dial in mostly then on the differences here boses Alcantara covered headband features noticeably better padding devoid of internal bumps that can dig into your head eventually but theyre sizing adjustment mechanism fits perfectly on my medium motorcycle helmet sized head at its smallest size and feels more plasticky compared to Sennheisers both of them offer about three and a half centimeters of total adjustment though so if your head is on the smaller side I expect youll get a better fit out of the pxc 550 the ear cups themselves aside from both being closed back designs with faux leather covered memory foam for optimal noise isolation are about as different as they could be Bose has gone with a more traditional oval shape for the cups and angled drivers inside to direct sound into your ear canals while Sennheiser has done a couple of more unusual things here so the transducer has this grille over the top of it that looks kind of like an apple slicer perhaps theres a noise isolation or other acoustic reason for this and theyve gone with a more ear like shape that fits well but in my opinion along with the boring black color choice makes the PXE 550 look considerably less stylish though some will find sex appeal in the user interface I suppose both headphones thankfully have the ability to operate with a wire if youre out of battery or even with active noise cancellation enabled with a wire if you just dont want to use the wireless to make it last longer but inexplicably they both rely on a two and a half mil two three and a half millimeter cable so order an extra or two now in case you lose the included one since you probably dont have a ton of those lying around with that said Wireless is sort of the point here isnt it so lets move on to that both of them will pair with an Android phone using NFC but while Bose has stuck with a traditional button based interface power on pairing mode here with volume adjustments and a multifunction button that handles media playback and phone calls over here sennheiser is using a fancy touchpad on the right ear cup that allows play and pause track skipping and volume adjustments with gestures fancy though it does still have some hardware buttons one to toggle the Bluetooth radio for battery savings during wired operation with noise canceling enabled one for toggling movie and speech optimized EQ profiles and a threeposition slider that lets you pick 0 active noise cancellation fully enabled active noise cancellation with the four included microphones or an adaptive mode that adjusts the level of noise cancellation depending on ambient noise levels conspicuously absent though is a power switch with Sennheiser opting to build it into the hinge a design choice that I personally do not prefer lets get back to noise cancellation though the QC 35 specs are less impressive looking than the PX e5 50s and I really like Sennheisers easy access to mix and match combinations of Bluetooth noise cancellation and wired or wireless interfaces but boses ANC is noticeably better in the real world this is particularly true of unpredictable sound like nearby conversation both of our competitors will cover consistent background noise like the low rumble of an engine almost completely at even a quite moderate listening volume like two to three bars on an iPhone and both of them managed to avoid that traditional problem with a and C products of a painful pressure sensation on the eardrums so thumbs up there the with that said a pair of construction ear protectors with a white noise generator inside would probably do the trick if all you wanted was to ignore the crying kid in the seat behind you how do they sad well theres no doubt in my mind on this one if youre an audiophile the pxc 550 is the better choice BOCES sound signature as much less veiled running off of a cable with the active noise cancellation disabled but while both products are operating as intended wirelessly with a and C and it should be noted with Bose you cannot turn the anc off if its powered and running wirelessly the QC 35 s have a very onedimensional sound to their bass reproduction and such strongly veiled mids that I found it hard to enjoy my favorite vocalists to be clear the pxc 550 s arent exactly on par with Sennheisers open backed audiophile products but theyre well balanced with tight punchy bass fun vocals and the good ol sennheiser veil on the highend that made them less fatiguing to listen to for long periods at least that would be entirely true if the PXE 550s were as comfortable as the QC 35 s I have got to give Bose though this is a narrow victory to be very clear here the nod when it comes to longterm comfort both of them are lightweight and stay in place very well but putting on Bose is offering it feels like your head is getting a hug from a friend while Sennheiser needs another few millimeters of padding on the headband to draw even here which isnt to say then that the back and forth trading of winds here is over bluetooth time Sennheiser only manages to identify your devices by numbers like phone one connected while Bose manages to inform me that its connected to Linuss iPhone when I turn it on with that said I can probably accept remembering which of my devices is phone one connected for the sake of superior range while I was working on writing this I had to run downstairs to hit the bathroom and I left my phone on my desk and it wasnt until Id been in there for but law actually okay never mind how long I was in there but the point is the PXE 550 s never missed a beat while my attempt to repeat my test with the QC 35 resulted in stuttering the moment I closed the door on to battery life then Im going to call this one a win for Bose though it is a very narrow victory partly because Bose advertises about 20 hours of battery life and delivered 24 and Sennheiser puts 30 hours on their website though thats based on a more ideal operating scenario and running more apples to apples against Bose it actually ended up being very similar but both of them can handle a full day of music playback without recharging the battery which is damn impressive so who is the winner then this is not an easy question to answer today Sennheiser is charging more and offering up more consistent Bluetooth connectivity and superior sound quality while bose boasts boasts better noise cancellation a better carrying case and a more comfortable design at a lower price there so I know this is a bit of a copout but frankly the conclusion is this youd have a very hard time going wrong with either of these so go ahead and flip a coin I am sure that you will be happy with your new wireless headphones and

several months have released theirs and also in the past Ive tested the jarba support elites and also the Apple earpods now as for the Samsung icon acts 2018 Edition I know you guys have been asking about that those are coming soon to the channel so be sure to subscribe to get notified well Megan Thompson also released their own with the Bo play e8 as always being transparent with you guys I personally pay for these at the very expensive retail price of 300 but testing the Vino h6 headphones and the a1 bluetooth speaker in the past theyve been amazing products well see how this one goes and see if the price is justified as always Ill place my affiliate links down in that video description below click those links for the most updated prices in real time you never know when these things like the one sale so without further ado Im Jimmy with Jims review room Im here to help you make a purchase decision welcome everyone to another review Bang amp Olufsen has always made some very nice products offering understated elegance in my personal opinion the model that you see on screen is called charcoal sand well theres a more stealthy option coming in black now theyre made of mostly plastic which works perfectly fine but having more metal to the touch or even a rubberized coating to give it a bit more texture would have been nice neither or I havent been picking here these are quality built now B no claims these are sweat and water resistance and with my testing risking my 300 earphones obviously dont try this at home i drench them and theyre still working perfectly fine today touching base on comfort and physical performance for ear tips are included plus one set of comply foam which works great if you want something a little bit more foam fitting or formfitting that foam fitting that is but keep in mind these are in ear earphones versus many of the competitors which sits somewhat in ear now resulting in less passive noise isolation now one of the biggest praises for the e eights they black out most of your outside environmental noises because its completely sealed in there they are very comfortable to wear as you can see they dont have air fans or ear wings for stability but they do stay in the ear very well also if you notice the Yeates might possibly have the lowest profile when wearing here and they dont stick out and look our can turn like the bose sound support fries that I just recently reviewed now moving on to the controls there are touch sensitive surfaces which very intuitive Im both earpieces a nice alternative to the physical button that sometimes you have to press into your head to activate sometimes now a single tap pauses and plays your music as well as answer and end phone calls now if Im is increased by tapping and holding the right earphone while holding the left side decreases it now Ill have a fullness and other side of my head here for your reference but the only feature that is not here basically and I wish every company would have this our voice prompts the e8 verbally doesnt tell me what my battery life is which device Im paired to and besides a quick audio beef having a voice prompt to indicate if Im in pairing mode or not would streamline my use now its not a reason to not buy these but paying three hundred dollars those features would have been nice but getting back to the earphones I mentioned these are able to take phone calls and you do get some background noise for cars driving by and footsteps being horrible like other ear phones but the voice on the other end came in super clear here and my voice for the recipients on the other end was good enough and I know how to pretend crystal clear but its very much usable also during phone calls the eh turns on the external microphones and pumps your surrounding audio ambient noise here into your ears so it eliminates all of the passive noise isolation for safety thats a pretty cool feature now moving on to the case it is small and when you first open the retail package its gonna smell like a shoe store or some highend leather boots so make sure you take a whiff here but also yours this a case very premium leather soft and supple and when you open it they do hold the ear buds with magnets which holds perfectly fine the case itself is able to charge your earphones two additional times essentially holding an additional eight hours of battery life and you can check how many additional charge cycles you have with the two LED lights on the rear pretty convenient now speaking of better life veno claims at four hours of playtime in my testing playing audio at 50 from full to bed I managed to get four hours in 25 minutes theres also quick charging which helps for men sleep with 20 minutes on the charger providing you an additional hour worth of playback no touching based on Bluetooth performance the e8r equivalent bluetooth 42 testing them in the office with my iPhone 10 and having them go through two walls average 61 linear feet before the audio started to crackle and thats great for what we have today once its paired the e aids does have a connection thats very stable for normal everyday use I never had an issue and all right last before I talk about the audio performance the one unique feature that be you know incorporated is transparency mode the microphone kicks on and youre able to select one or three levels to hear your environment with the left ear bub you can tap and turn it on or off but unfortunately you cant cycle through each option though you have to do so within the bill play app now with transparency mode activated its perfect for runners are those walking during their commute and wanting to hear their environments again for safety again these provide excellent passive noise isolation if you want to eliminate that you have the option to do so so right folks to the moment youve been waiting for the audio test the e aids do get loud here Im constantly fighting myself listening comfortably but loud s 60 to 70 percent vine bass wise they sound slightly bassy but tends to lean and the more accurate sound signature rather than truly being bass boosted now if I were to compare its Emily to the Bose sound support freeze and the job or support elites both absolutely truly wireless earphones its not bass books its sounding like a jaybird runs but its a bit more of a true fine performance compared to a jaybird recent release if youre a bass head I will look into those but the eh is surely enough for most people now in the mid ranges there is a balance that equally and accurately portrays both the instruments and the vocals focus are surely not recessed but it does stand front and center without being bright now same with instruments and its imaging it stands out but at a pleasing and neutral level they arent colourful but as a positively to do sound accurate and well pronounced when youre listening to highquality audio files as for the high notes music thats a bit more mellow doesnt have a lot of attack or is very fast per se sounded absolutely fine the it does absolutely well in that regards now when listening to the opposite where theres tons of synthesized high frequencies a lot of the upper frequencies are just going on it just sounds really cluttered you lose a lot of resolution and detail it gets slightly jumbled in at times not necessarily ear piercing but can be sharp at times on those fast attacking songs the high frequencies do overpower or overshadow the mid frequencies just by a smidge taking away from the experience a slight bit that is now as for soundstage the EAS perform better than average its not the best but you do get some depth and truly clear left and right audio separation although it does better than half the market and competitors out there and wasnt as strong or close to say the Bose sound sport freeze or the shape or runs now Pino does offer the vo play app and offers a simplified tutor called tongue touch Odin gets you warm made the autumn muffled and didnt really increase bass to my liking increasing excited or bright slightly did help improve the audio to be a bit more pronounced but other that the app didnt offer much more besides better level indication and adjusting the transparency the tone of transparency settings which we discussed a little bit earlier and most will be fine having it and stock but the option to adjust is there now last but not least video delay has been a big topic and truly wireless earphones lately tested ee8 with netflix theres a fractional delay very minimal but on youtube you can see lips moving first before you hear the audio this was also the same on the sony WF 1000x and the bose sound support freeze that Ive recently tested in the channel now they dont stick out my ear like crazy here which I absolutely am appreciative of they have decent better life and they stick inside your ear comfortably as well that might justify its price tag but the audio was not the best but its on the very good side of things when listening to other truly wireless earphones that I have at the office so folks please let me know in the comment section below what you guys think as always be sure to LIKE and subscribe to show your support and finally man Facebook Twitter and or Instagram you guys take care and Ill see you on the next one bye you",

gonna be talking about a brand new headset thats a revamp on a classic headset now Im talking about the brand new Sony Playstation gold Music now it comes with the USB dongle because this is a wireless headset and you do need that to be able to play wirelessly and you can do that through your ps4 and your PC it does come with a micro USB cable because that is for charging with these being Wireless you definitely want to make sure that they charge and to be honest battery life is not anything special in fact youre probably gonna get around eight to ten hours which in a gaming session is fun youre gonna find yourself that youre gonna be charging these things pretty often and so the last accessory that comes with it is the headphone cable now that way you can use these if they die you can use them plugged into your controller you can use them plugged in your phone Nintendo switch any other device that has a normal headphone jack alright so the headphones themselves as you can tell one of the big problems with the original PlayStation Gold wireless headset is the fact that they hinge because the old ones folded in was very fragile in fact they broke very often and a lot of people had that issue the headband on the other ones were a lot thicker they they thin down the design its very sleek its just black all over there is some gloss trim around right below where the ear cup is I dont like the gloss I dont like the fact that where youre touching all the buttons is going to be gloss so its gonna pick up all the fingerprints thats just kind of nitpicking but I just thought I should point that out your left and right or marked on the inside right behind the ear cup which the ear cup does slide up and down inside the headband itself so the again but there being no hinges that is a nice way to be able to get them to fit and I found getting them to fit was no issue at all now the ear cups on these it is a very soft pleather now if I had to kind of describe the design of the ear cup if youre familiar with them at all the ear cup is like the PlayStation Gold as far as the way that its lined up but its the material of the Platinum I would say its closer to the PlayStation platinum headset as far as the ear cups go theyre really comfortable they do get warm so if youre gonna do long gaming sessions youre probably going to take some breaks here and there just to keep from overheating now buttons and controls every thing is on your lefthand side on the front part of the headphone right at the bottom is off one in two theres two sound settings that you can program by getting the headphone app within the PlayStation youre able to get you know theres only a few options right now but I know with updates they will add a lot more to these right above that is your sound and chat level it does have mic monitoring you youre able to control if youre wanting to hear more of the sound of the game or more of the chat you can control them right here on the front part now on the bottom is where you have your headphone jack and your micro USB port to where you plug them in you have your mute button and then you have your volume up and down and then at the very very back at the top is your virtual surround sound these do have virtual 71 surround sound and do an incredible job at separating sound and giving you really good awareness of where everything is at now lets go ahead since it was talking about the microphone you do see that there is not a pull out mic and one thing I do want to say is that the microphone on the original playstation gold was not anything special but lets go ahead and see what they sound like on the new gold alright so here is a mic test of the new playstation wireless gold as you can tell again the microphone I dont know what Sonys thinking theyre just not putting any effort and making the mic sound good at least just give us a boom mic its okay that if theres a microphone sticking out we will take that over having a microphone that sounds like this the microphone just sucks alright so build quality look at this you couldnt do this with the original PlayStation gold you can do this but you wouldnt be able to do it again because its very likely it would snap I dont feel any issues with twisting this this right here the build quality alone is worth it now these do retail for 99 99 is not bad at all for a wireless headset so now lets go ahead and get into the sound the sound of these to me is where they kind of fall in between the PlayStation Gold the original one and then the platinum it felt warmer to me sound wise which means it had a little basse little more oomph in the sound than it in the original playstation gold had with the virtual surround sound again youre just able to pinpoint where everything is located the presets that are built into it I didnt find anything that I liked more than anything else so I just kept it on the one setting which is just the one thats already built in and now thats what listening to music games everything like that one setting is to spawn enough the other ones to me just kind of are gimmicks and theyre pinpointing things that I dont think are really that special now based on these I can tell you right now theyre very punchy theyre really warm sounding so like I said that also brings out explosions and gunshots it just feels more natural mids and troubles are very good its really good at being able to hear vocals with people talking to you you can definitely definitely sound  __  in these you you can tell where everything is I I had no issue being able to hear where everything was at its just a very spacious headset now I can show you while theyre on they dont stick out very much but there are Sony did design these so that they work with their VR headset so there is a gap here so that you dont have any interference if youre wanting to use these for your PlayStation VR and it does a damn good job with the VR headset now using these four movies is also incredible watching Netflix and anything like that on your Playstation or your PC these do a great job with that these really are geared towards being an entertainment headset as far as movies and games thats where they excel but as far as music goes I wouldnt buy these personally for music but you know for 99 to get a wireless gaming headset that sounds this good and offers this many features its kind of hard to be alright guys so that is my review of the brand new Playstation Gold wireless headset from Sony I think they did a really good job they kept the price also at the exact same as the old they did some very very nice improvements except for the microphone which they havent improved at all build quality is much better sound is much better its just a really really great overall headset for under 100 bucks thats really the way to look at it alright guys so Sony the Sony you did a great job I really really recommend these if youre looking to buy a wireless headset thats under 100 its gonna be really really hard to beat this unless youre just looking for an incredible microphone thats the only reason I would say not to get these if you dont use a mic or online play is not the most important thing to you if youre not streaming like twitch and stuff like that with a microphone these would definitely be the ones to get alright guys so thank you so much for checking out this video thank you guys so much for checking out all the other videos and as always guys make sure to stay tuned for more", "video_title": "The NEW 2018 Sony Playstation

" hey everyone Jimmy wouldnt James review room trying to bring you guys the newest stuff in the market Bose just released their sound sport wireless earphones geared towards Fitness fans out there now they come in two colors aqua which I have here and then theres that stuff all black model I did personally pay for this at the retail price of one hundred and fifty dollars making these slightly cheaper than some of the premium models out there but well see how these go though as always Ill place my links in the video description below click on my links and they will give you the most updated prices in real time and if you decide to buy of course this will help support my channel so without further ado Jimmy with Jims review room and Im here to help you make a purchase decision welcome everyone to another review going over the physical features first I do admit these are a bit bigger than what I anticipated but of course looks are subjective now although theres audio ports exposed Bose claims these are to be water in sweat resistant and for my testing spring water all over these the Bose sound sports still works perfectly fine now looking at the right earphone theres your power button up top LEDs to indicate when this is fully charged or almost dead in regards to battery life and a Bluetooth connection indicator on the bottom there is a microUSB port for charging the sound sports and Bose is claiming up to six hours of use which is somewhat in the midrange when youre comparing with other sport your phones on the market at 50 vibe I was able to get seven hours and four minutes worth of use now moving on with the physical bill the left ear but doesnt have any physical buttons or features but moving down the cord here its thick and feels very durable while still being very flexible tossing these into my bag without the included case they never tangled or under abuse they held up really well now there is an inline controller with volume up and down with a pause play and song skipping feature and this does work for both Apple and Android devices the only thing though the buttons are very firm compared to any other earphones Ive tested also when pressing the buttons you do feel the buttons slide from side to side from time to time which was a bit unusual at first its not a dealbreaker but I do admit you do get used to it after your first use or two but something I wanted to point out now last the inline controller does come with NFC or near field communication builtin which is very handy tap your NFC compatible phone and the earphones pairs with your device automatically last you can use this as a headset for phone calls and testing this with several friends my voice is very clear it does pick up some background noise though but at least my voice didnt sound far away or distorted it performs very well though now going into comfort both features theyre super soft ear tips called stay here plus three ear tips are included from small medium to large and of course the fit will be subjective as everyones ears are a little bit different here but for the most part they stayed in my ears very well here but not the perfect skier hold that I was looking for the stay here ear tips are not in your earphones theyre not snug inside that ear canal but it rests on the opening you can still hear your environments which is ideal for cyclists or runners to ensure that you may hear someone coming up on you or maybe here traffic around you they are very comfortable however during vigorous activities at least for my ears again the top ear wing would pop out sometimes and the earphones would not fall out though but I would periodically have to push that top ear wing back in from my channel and reviewing previous Bose products most people do find their general ear tips to work really well though so I would still give them a shot regarding wire noise when you are running the wires can bounce around or rub against ur shirts but these sound sports does very well not carrying any noise into the earphones when music is going you dont hear the wires bouncing around at all something to look into when you are looking for earphones in general and last regarding sound quality in BOCES fashion here they still provide a very nice clean audio signature its not loud or brash but a sound signature that is very easy to listen to even at loud violence you wont have hearing fatigue after youre done using them now Bose is claiming to have a dynamic volume optimized equalizer so the sound characteristics would change as you adjust vine up and down I didnt notice really much of a change but it all happens behind the scenes but in general here base is punchy fast and accurate its not a deep sub bass it doesnt Rumble like the powerbeats2 or have a bass booster signature like the jbird products if you prefer that more accurate and clean audio signature the bose performs good in that aspect regarding the mids its clear accurate once again it isnt bright at all nor is it recessed or boxy it really performs right in the middle of the audio spectrum feeling unaltered but the highs are distortion free and turn this up at much higher violence theres no ting or ear ringing I do admit though the topend doesnt sound as detailed though as I would have hoped top hats cymbal crashes and the likes were not as acute at louder vibes sensing there some rolloff from Bose to keep the audio signature safe from going overboard now regarding soundstage there isnt much there but I have noticed though most sport earphones Ive reviewed so far they dont provide much of a soundstage anyways the only brand that does provide a very expansive experience has been jbird and les regarding wireless range these work perfectly walked from one side of the house to the other and downstairs as well the signal never broke or degraded when going through several walls and the first floor ceiling last both introduced their own app when they released the bose qc25 headphones and a sound sport here works with the same app just like the QC 35s experience there isnt much there theres a battery level indicator volume adjustment if you go into settings you can adjust the power down time period when the earphones are not in use turn on or off the voice prompts and manage your parrot devices other than that theres no audio profiles theres no app equalizer or a music player builtin so thats everything on the new bose sound support wireless here I really do like them and the audio signature is very clean the fit was good but not the greatest to me however they were very comfortable again folks check out my links in the description below for the updated prices and be sure to LIKE and subscribe if you havent follow me on Facebook

"zDPU1XmgQpk", "Closed Captions": " well my quest for the perfect gaming headset continues  everybody take a look at something from Coursera these are the new virtuoso wireless gaming headsets something they sent over because they saw how I was not happy with the GS 670 or whatever its called from Sennheiser because the mic quality was so terrible they didnt even say I had to do a review on these but I figured I would share because I cant be the only person searching for a wireless headset that doesnt suck todays video is brought to you by Nord VPN a virtual private network things that you should have and plenty of you still dont which baffles me but I guess thats kind of the whole point of this ad now listen a VPN which stands for a virtual private network is extremely important whether youre browsing on your phone your laptop your desktop if you are sending information out to the Internet you never know whos looking at it which is why a virtual private network with militarygrade encryption like Nord VPN is a must especially with the holiday season coming up on with all the travel youre probably going to be doing whether you want to or not youre still going to be doing it get your devices protected the Nord VPN has thousands of servers across 60 countries to make sure that no matter where youre connected or traveling this holiday season you are going to be protected minority PM takes your data packages it up into a nice encrypted packet sends it off to the server and then connects to the internet from there so prying eyes have absolutely no idea on the networks that youre connected on as to what youre doing online your ISP is also like to slow you down because they want to shape your traffic to make sure youre not using all of your bandwidth with things like Netflix and YouTube like this video right here but if you dont know what youre doing they cant really slow you down so show your ISP whos boss by downloading Nord VPN today now by using my link and my offer code in the description below jsu cents at checkout you can get 70 off a threeyear membership and given how expensive a VPN is I think you can go without a coffee or two per month to pay for this dont wait any longer pause the video click the link in the description below use my offer code Jase two cents that check out and get Nord VPN today alright so the two products were taking a look here are virtually the same but virtually the virtuoso this is a SC for special edition and then weve got the just the rail er virtuoso so these are in white theyre also available in black well kind of take a look at the build difference between the two of them but in terms of the important parts the mic quality the headphone drivers the slipstream technology the fact that they can be used as both wired and wireless and yes spoiler alert unlike the Sennheisers when theyre plugged into a cable you do get increased bandwidth connectivity with your PC which means better mic quality and the sound quality is pretty much the same because sound is still the priority when it comes to the compression theres a little bit of difference in the microphone but were talking about these because theyre theyre actually worth talking about so all the important parts the headband design the ear cup design the foam Manila its the same on these the difference is just a little bit more of a premium build on these guys the SES then on the standard plastic ones although they still say aluminium to our plastic bits will show you what they are and I dont normally do unboxings but these are important when it comes to peripherals like this especially headphones so these are the special editions Ive already been using them a little bit so a little bit of fingerprints and dirt on there they are brushed aluminum or aluminium depending what part of the world youre from when it comes to the cans so this part right here is very attractivelooking what I like is they dont have a stupid look about them do you see how stupid these look I swear to god I look like Im a crew chief on some sort of a NASCAR team these look ridiculous on my head like build quality I would say that theyre very similar but just look at the difference here like thats more of a head shape whose head is this shape actually when Phil put him on I didnt look as ridiculous because Phils got a very round head Ive got a very square narrow head but when I put these on I feel less stupid I still probably look pretty Susie but the first thing you might notice is obviously theres no cables attached to it and theres no microphone they come with this carrying bag right here and the reason why you might want a carrying bag for them is because as you also notice like we just said and theres also stuff in there with words on it we have our microphone which obviously is detachable and it only goes one way like the hey only goes on your left side this is where Im gonna give points actually to Sennheiser I have become a huge fan because Ive been using the game zeroes and the PC 37 X is now exclusively for like four years but what I love is this this swivel way swivel away microphone and you can hear that click when it swivels up it automatically mutes so the very first time I was wearing these I was like just on the microphone and it just bent up and nothing happened I was like oh yeah because the mute button for this is located right on the bottom right there so as you can see this is you know bendable because of the fact that everyones mouth and head is a little bit different so it only goes one way and theres that even the the microphone end right here is I believe that too aluminum as well so when it comes to the dongle here it is right here this is a 24 gigahertz dongle using Corsairs new slipstream technology something they actually talked about at CES you can control up to 3 devices at the same time anything 3 devices that use slipstream so that can be headsets mice keyboards but it also has its like active scanning for finding strong signals because 24 is so crowded its constantly scanning for stronger signals or clearer signals I should say and it dynamically adjusts without having any sort of dropouts which because of that theyre boasting a like higher than ever signal strength which also means longer range and better connectivity for Less dropouts so theres that so youve got two cables here one thats a lot less relevant today than its ever been that being a headphone jack for your phones because now that Samsung has also kind of dropped the headphone jack youre going to need this into a dongle into a USB C or lightning or whatever connector you need for your phone you could take this mic off and you could use these as a wired connection device to your phones when youre on the bus to school or the train or whatever and have a single product that kind of meets all of your needs there I personally never use these because I dont know I dont really listen to music and stuff when I travel like to just take that moment to relax without hearing kids screaming and YouTube people commenters yelling at me and yeah Im kind of boring in terms of build quality weve got what feels like a leather its probably a pleather but its a memory foam up in here in the headband so its nice and squishy obviously its got stability on either side metal hinge so this is going to be nice and robust this is often where gaming headsets break lets face it were gamers we get mad we throw our when we are not Battle Royale or we lose an arena and Warcraft or whatever they theyre robust trust me I know Ive already thrown them once I got durability tests youve got to do it but you know you pick up something you go oh yeah yeah I feels like quality yeah thats exactly what these feel like because they are fairly round instead of like ear shaped I find that my ear tends to touch the bottom and the top just a little bit doesnt really seem to bug me a whole lot but its something worth mentioning my ear does not touch the actual driver cover at all speaking of driver these are 50 millimeter drivers so they definitely are able to reproduce some lowfrequency bass but in terms of buttons youve got a volume dial on the back of the right hand side or back of the right ear cup so this will tie right into your windows volume its a little laggy and that youve got to kind of scroll it quite a bit to get it to go up and down in volume and then weve got a toggle here that switches between wired and wireless thats also your power switch so by switching it to wireless I just turned them on and thats why youre seeing now the the colors going there and then if you switch it back to wired thats also what turns it off now USBC cable here which is whats gonna be terminating to your standard USB to a USB see this is also your charger cable you can charge while still connected to wireless but if youre connected to the computer I would just switch it to Wired mode youre gonna get better mic quality anyway so whats the difference now between the SES and the standard edition this is plastic instead of the brushed metal which you can see right there you can see theyre the same hinge the same earcups the real difference here is the fact that you dont get the carrying bag with them and theyve got that plastic face otherwise all the accessories that come in this box are exactly the same well though the microphone is slightly different appearance wise so you can see its a much smaller piece in the end where the microphone goes this is the special edition now before we talk about the sound quality of them I want to talk about a few of the the software features now IQ is technically how you support and control this headset things like the RGB LEDs built into them which if I turn on right here youll see so the RGB thats inside of them the EQ is controlled by IQ the EQ and IQ also side tone side tone is important with these because theyre so theyre so good at sound isolation you can find yourself probably screaming at people not realizing how loud youre talking so a side tone what it does is it feeds some of the microphone back into the headset so that you can hear your own voice that way youre not screening those are the three major functions you get like IQ really is kind of lackluster in terms of control on this theres no loudness control I wish that there was more volume coming out of these and that could just be I dont know what the limitations are over the the actual USB power signal but I feel like because these are 50 millimeter drivers Im feeling like these need to be a little bit louder I feel like theyre relying heavily on the sound isolation of these to make them seem louder than you than they are but you dont need IQ thats kind of the best part about this is unless you are using some sort of a standalone wellthats are not using some sort of standalone thirdparty application that could control USB devices and apply an EQ on top of the controller you really dont need Iike EQ IQ I went in there and I downloaded it but its not installed I just left the screen up right there so you could see that this is without IQ Im just plugging in the wireless dongle or the wireless wired USB C hooked up to the headset its automatically setting it up as a USB device thats a nice thing about it being USB at least where analog headphones you know youve got to run them through an amp analog is definitely to get you the most control because if youre a true audiophile youre gonna probably have headphone amplifiers anyway at the very least deck so you probably wouldnt be using a USB device anyway if youre an audiophile so if youre an audio file when youre here watching these its probably just to make fun of them and get you trust me I get you I digress when it comes to setting them up though windows handles everything because its a standard USB device the unfortunate thing about doing a review about headphones is I you cannot experience them I could only relay what my inner ear hairs and inner drum is hearing and all of our hearing is different so what Im gonna do is Im gonna try to do the best I can to describe the soundstage of these one they are either a 71 simulate which is again controlled an IQ or a standard stereo I tend to leave them in stereo Im not a fan of 71 simulate I find the sound statements around to sound obnoxiously wide and distant now the sound stage on stereo is still very wide and spacious but realistic the base frequency of these I did I did a sweeping bass test with these with a sweeping tone at 35 Hertz I still got some some audio out of it I dont know what the SPL level would have been but it was extremely shallow but it was still audible at 50 Hertz they definitely recreated a good amount of bass but not overpowering it doesnt muddy the rest of the the frequency but I feel like of course theres done a really good job at tuning the frequency on these to give you a full soundstage on these where youre able to get good lows clear mids crisp eyes its the best way to explain it Ive said it before Im gonna say it again IQ needs work there I was getting random crashes I was getting one time the microphone wouldnt work at all Corsair reached back out to us we did talk to them there is still some tuning thats happening with these in terms of software and there may be some more features thatll come online in the future hopefully some sort of loudness control or just an overall volume bump but if you just let windows control it you still get a really good experience its time to do the mic test though because sound quality of these in my opinion are matched with the Sun Heisers a little bit lower volume but in terms of clarity and just richness or fullness I guess these are definitely on par with a more expensive headset so weve got audacity going here we also have our AC going and the reason why Im doing that is Im curious as to what the noise cancellation of this is like so you can see if the capsule picks up right here is a little bit of an opening it should be rejecting a lot of the background noise but the AC is pretty loud this would be the equivalent of having like a window AC in your room running thats how much volume there is coming from it so I want to see how well it can reject that sound and then well turn it off that way its a pretty clean mic test about any sort of ambient noise sort of affecting any of the white noise or the sound floor because the audacity is seeing us is that this is the waveform you can see its the volume is pretty good weve not gone into windows and changed any of the settings its still set to microphone being maximum level so three two one one two three and I didnt even get fill of clap so Ill give it to him at the end of the clip so you could sink it there so one thing I want to point out is I dont know if theres a builtin pop filter in this Ive gotten to the point to where I figured out exactly where I can put it but if I move it like so right here so my nose is being picked up Pease Paul Peter picked a peck of pickled peppers Pauls hardware is Paulie but he shares another Twitter handle with another Pauls Ace Hardware and people keep tweeting at Pauls Ace Hardware thinking its Pauls hardware and apparently they have thought hot dog sales apparently the nice thing about this being adjustable like this is you can move it all around you can move it down a little bit but then the nose gets it the mouth doesnt then I thing about being adjustable Mike as you can find a spot none of your air gets it but were gonna do now is we are going to go ahead and switch over to wireless because what I love about this headset and I said the Sennheisers dont is it goes oh hey were wired we have more audio bandwidth available to us for the microphone so lets leverage that alright so we turned off the AC because like I said we want to make sure that theres no contamination of background noise that was a really loud AC so were gonna do now is now were gonna do another we are unwired right okay up is wired were gonna do a wired versus Wireless saying the same sentence so you guys can kind of hear them back to back this is wired the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog Peter picked a peck of pickled peppers so here is the wireless test the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog Peter picked a peck pick a peck of peppers pickled pepper she sells seashells down by the seashore these are by far the best wireless headphones Ive listened to in terms of microphone quality but theres a little bit of artifacting which sounds like the best way to describe it it sounds like a slight crackling right underneath the audio its not annoying and its a hundred percent better than this crap this is genuine disappointment because it means that these will not be come my daily driver microphone but at the end of the day you have options with this and I think that thats whats making this like 95 of what Im looking for in a gaming headset Coursera sent these over specifically because of that Sennheiser review and theyre like hey weve got a new headset coming tell us what you think dont even have to make a review about it but I chose to make this review because I think theyre based on that Sennheiser video theres a lot of people in my particular boat that I like boats theres a lot of people in my boat that are looking for the same thing okay whats the USS wireless headset okay but Jay if its 95 there whats wrong with them I want more volume out of them I like loud Ive killed my hearing already with shooting guns for recreation and doing I used to actually build base systems for DB drags back in the early 2000s and that kind of fried a lot of my hearing I hope Corsair can increase the volume of these a little bit through a software update I will probably use these wired more than wireless but I wanted the wireless option the problem is if you look right here they come off at about a 45 degree angle on that ear off that ear cut its a big dongle or the USB see where it plugs in which is knurled and metal and beefy and this is a braided cable which is awesome but it points it right at my shoulder so when I turn my head to all that sound travels through the wire into the ear cup and I can hear it its like a cannon a string when you talk to two people with two Bulgers cans in a string its the same thing the sound travels through and its picked up in my ear cut they prioritized the straight down plug for the one Im never going to use which is the threeandahalf millimeter dual Jack for mic and headset for your smartphone or your mp3 player or whatever I feel like that should be reversed I feel like I should have the smaller jack coming out the back and the bigger jack coming straight down the other thing is when Im hooked up to the wired and and Corsair has acknowledged that they are trying to recreate this and theyre trying to figure out what our particular issue was on my desk both desktops here at the studio and at home I was getting not enough USB resources for the device error popping up consistently what ended up solving it quite honestly was toggling this to wireless and back to wired and then it didnt do it again so theres still some bugs in there I know I did it these are probably my daily drivers now I never bothered with the Sennheiser because of that mic quality I mean that is so so terrible the two versions of these are like I said theyre gonna be more so in premium quality of some of the materials used but if you want to save some money I would just recommend getting the black or the white theyre gonna sound the same theyre gonna feel the same were just gonna have the brushed aluminum sides right there and youre gonna save like 30 bucks the thing is if you compare the pricing of these versus like the sennheiser products or some of the other wireless stuff thats out there like the Astros and all that these are a heck of a lot cheaper these are under 200 and look how bright the LEDs are on these guys like I feel like the LEDs are better on here then on here because these are having to shine through that drilled out aluminum and you can see theres much more glow to those if you want glowy well there you go so huge thank you to Corsair for sending these over to us for us to take a look at like I said they were very much so like you dont have to make a review I think cuz they saw how harsh I was with the Sennheiser Ive got nothing but good things to say about it I just would like to see the software that controls them improve and thats pretty much it you guys any headphones out there you think I should take a look at make sure you put them down the comments below Im still looking for that 100 satisfying experience Im really picky if you cant tell alright thats it thanks bye", "video_title": "FINALLY A Wireless Headset that DOESNT SUCK Everyone NEEDS

launched JBL 300 tws true a wireless earbuds and as you can see guys its over here Ive already opened it up and Ive been testing it for a day or so so actually these go inside these like this left and right oh yeah one over here and it closes in the box and as you can see it also has a LED light over here that Meno means its actually charging while its charging it denotes and right now the battery is about 50 percent handsets  lets we have three less youll come back to this later so it comes in this box and it says pure bass and definitely yes the bass is actually significantly boosted on these ones and yeah it says that the pricing is seven thousand nine hundred on because its available on Flipkart for three thousand nine hundred and ninetynine rupees as you can see what the link and again here gives us a basic idea about the yachts we actually have physical buttons Ill show you so you can control a lot of stuff and also the battery life in my testing was actually pretty good on this one they came about five hours with the buds but you also have that case so its about 12 hours of extra on this one so apart from this you just get a few other accessories I will just show you that it is a box you get a micro USB cable sadly yes micro USB not USB typec and we also get extra pair of the year tips to extra in get on this I didnt change it Im using the default one it fitted me perfectly but my daughter said that the default fit was a little bit tight so you might have to change can start from that the standard manual and stuff we get at Quick Start Guide and all those things and basic stock I would say so let me take these things to the side for now and lets look at these so this is the main thing and as you can see it has that JBL branding and this is actually made up of plastic but its actually decent quality plastic but again as I have told you um the charging is micro USB the latest Ive seen but apart from that reacts okay and you open this up and these are true Wireless so you take it out and while its charging me also I dont think so yeah camera can pick it up we also have a small LED Lee on this tip trial its charging this also close in white color when its in the box but again you dont have to worry as its charging it denotes like this so it just stays on like this while its charging when its fully charged please just stop so thats what it is and if you just take these out and put you can put it in here left and right and guys because these are in here they do form a good seal so sort of acts like noise cancellation they dont have any active noise cancellation but the seal is actually really good so it blocks about 90 of the sound around you and even at about 50 volume if youre listening you cant hear anything so its passive for noise cancellation that we have and in terms of comfort myself told you I didnt change the tips Im using default tips and for me theyre comfortable they sit in your year and if you do this also it does not fall but again you might have to change the tips for the perfect effort you have to play around for that and it just fits in here like this or it will be looking like this as you can see apart from thing this one good thing that I like on these earbuds is that you have that JBL logo but we actually have physical buttons both on the right side like this and even on the left side and using this you control stuff for example on the right side one you can play in pause music why this Ive just activated it and Ill just press it once or just force and when you get a call also you can actually just press this and you can take the call and the left one you will use again this also has a physical button youll use it to skip tracks or even go back to a previous track so that is the functionality and I really like this one because with many of the other earbuds and stuff the problem is that they have that touch sensor or something and most of time it does not work with this one we dont have that problem because its a physical button that we are getting and it works every time and again one of the thing that Ive noticed is that as you can see I have only one bird oh yes and other but Ive just kept it back here and it works that we also for example while youre taking calls and stuff you dont want both of them so you can just put one and it worked so that is also a good thing with this one so thats what it is now lets talk about the battery life the battery life as Ive told you the battery life is actually pretty good on this one roughly about four or slightly above four hours you should get within a charge but again you will keep it back in this what do you say charger this case so it starts charging automatically and this will give you about three charges and it charged this this will take approximately about to us so I mean typical what you get seeing stuff so battery life is good because many of the year but generally these portable ones give about two or three hours this is decent enough this will give you more than about for us and the pairing was also not an issue as you can see you also have these LED lights over here its glowing here its connected to my phone thats why so you have that so you have that notification and now if we talk about the Bluetooth range here also I was happy with a brutal three these are typical the supports Bluetooth file and these typically have the about thirty feet of line of sight if nothing is there but again you dont use it like that in a typical room I would say I was able to hear the songs without any skip page even when I was in the next room without any issue so the range is actually good on this one not a problem with the range and yesterday I used it continuously for about three and a half hours I even watch the movie I listen to music and during the three hours continuously it never disconnected or skipped so thats actually nice now lets talk about the one of the most important things I feel that is how does it sound if I have to rate it first lets divide it into three parts the bass then well talk about midtones the vocals and midtones and the height and here I would say in terms of bass as you see in the box it says that pure beings and stuff I think so they have gone really bonkers with that definitely the base is sort of emphasized on this one and boost it quite a bit dont get me wrong I I would say the base is more emphasized but that is the sound signature that most of us Indians actually like we like some extended base so you definitely had that but I would say they have really tuned it to have that extra extra base for most of the music I really enjoyed the bass that you are getting but we do have some tracks we are already we have some boosted bass I felt that the bass was slightly excessive so in terms of bass I would rated 8 out of 10 now if we talk about the vocals and the midtones here I would say JB and has really nailed it the vocals sounded spectacular smooth really forward they do I feel how its tuned the vocals stand out quite a bit on this one and the midtones are also produced very well the sounds of instruments and stuff of very very soothing so I would rate it 10 on 10 in terms of vocals and midtones and now moving to the higher tone higher frequencies they were also very well produced on this one and I would rate it nine point five out of ten so overall I would say very good sounding your Falls but suddenly it does have that slightly excessive bass which I feel many of the users at least in India like that and if I have to talk about the soundstage the sound state is also very good it has excellent excellent stereo separation you can really make out that the sound is coming from this track this the what do you say instrument separation is also done very well so the sound stage is also very very damp so overall they sound really great I would say the battery life is also a decent if after nitpick the two minor cons that I notice with this one as that micro USB port instead of USB typec that you are getting on this one and that slightly extended bass that Ive noticed but again I feel most of you would like that and if I have to actually read these earphones I would rate them 45 out of 5 so guys that was my review of the said JBL c100 pw s and these are sold in india why I flipped on I leave the link in the description below for reference anyways guys what do you feel about these one and if you guys are still not subscribed to my youtube channel hit that subscribe button thats it for all

industry but with no options to adjust the volume exclusive features to iOS and a somewhat questionable design many people are now looking to other in some cases superior competitors the elite 65 TS are arguably the best of these alternatives competing in terms of battery and connection and succeeding with audio quality and design now jabber aback with the new elite active 65 t an upgrade suitable for those with a more active lifestyle in this video ill be comparing these against Jerez dedicated sports earbuds the elite sport hopefully by the end of the video youll have a better idea which of these earphones is right for you and if either of these can be crowned the champion of true wireless earphones lets take a look Music Ill be unboxing both earbuds sidebyside with the black elites port on the left and the copper blue Alif active on the right both the original color designs both boxes indicate the headphones are suitable for sports in fact the elites Porter branded the most technically advanced true Wireless sports air buds so during the video well see just how accurate this claim really is the boxes have a similar design pattern but have different opening mechanisms the sports with an easier to access magnetic clasp whilst the active simply slide out from the sleeve getting into the boxes though both have the earbuds and their charging case is packaged separately and have largely the same accessories each include the Quick Start Guide safety and warranty info and a micro USB cable for charging again a pet peeve of mine is that even a 2018 pair of true wireless earbuds doesnt feature USB see the elite actives come with a set of small medium and large silicon ear tips whereas the elites board have a range of silicon and foam ear tips plus a choice of wind tips which will definitely come in handy for more rigorous exercising sadly wingtips are not compatible with the elite active 65 T accessories aside we can turn our attention back to the earbuds and theyre charging cases which have slightly different designs the elite sport charging case is rectangular with the micro USB ports on the side theres a hidden LED indicator located just next to this and there are LEDs for aged earbud on the case as well the case snaps open and close from a sturdy hinge and theres space inside for your earbuds if youre using the included wing tips via buds themselves are made from silicone rubber and weigh in at 6 and 12 grams each they both feature LEDs for microphones to maximize call quality and the elite sport contains a builtin heart rate monitor and analyzer the earbuds are also ip67 rated so theyre not only completely dust proof but also fully waterproof up to one meter for 30 minutes the elite active case features a rounded capsule light design where the microUSB port and led are located at the bottom I did find this case a little more tricky to open especially at the beginning but this does become easier over time B about themselves feature a silicon rubber and plastic combination and have goldplated metal covering the LEDs interestingly the right earbud is also six and a half grams but the left is only five point eight we also have a four mic system and accelerometer and motion sensor but no heart rate monitor with this model the 65 TI P 56 rated so again completely dust proof and resistant to powerful Jets of water but you wont be able to fully submerge this model its also fairly easy to drop either of these earbuds into the charging case but sadly neither feature magnets to lock your earbuds in place a nice feature is that removing the air bus from the case will wake them automatically and theyll connect to the last pair device when you place them back theyll automatically disconnect and switch off so after the initial pairing youll never need to physically turn on or off the earbuds and this does work with both models between models we have slightly different control systems with the elite sport the left earbud features clickable volume buttons which also serve to skip tracks forward and back the right earbud features clickable sports and also multifunction buttons the sports button is used for various commands which are all directed through the Jabra sport life app and Ill talk more about this later on the multifunction button is used to play pause music answer and hang up phone calls and also to bring up your phones voice assistant its also used to activate the hair through feature turning on the microphones to allow you to hear your surroundings whilst the sports earbuds did offer a wide variety of control options I did find the buttons themselves quite difficult to press they give a satisfying click when pressed but do require a fair amount of force to trigger for me this meant pressing the earbud further into my ear canal which sometimes caused a little discomfort a workaround I found was to secure the ear but with a couple of fingers before pressing the buttons the right earbud can also be used on its own for mono playback in fact removing the left ear bud will automatically switch the right ear bud to mono and stereo playback resumes when the left earbud is placed back there are however no auto pause options here with the Elise active the control scheme is much more refined and simple the left ear but again features volume up and down which can be held to skip tracks the right earbud features just a single multifunction button used for playpause phone calls and activating your phones voice assistant if you prefer you can also switch this command to instead activate Alexa or the Google assistant using the jabber sound Plus app transforming your earbuds into a controller for your lights and speakers but you may need their accompanying apps to gain full voice control again the here through feature is activated with a double press the elite active earbuds contain a proximity sensor so removing either earbud can auto pause your music the writing part can also be is for mono playback by removing the left earbud and pressing the right ear bug to continue play back again I did need to use a few fingers when pressing the controls to avoid discomfort but the elite active buttons were far easier to press requiring less force and I did prefer the overall simplified control scheme and auto paws feature one important thing Id like to mention about these earbuds is that selecting the right ear tips and wingtips as well as how you position the earbuds in your is is absolutely crucial to getting the most out of them its also vital for ensuring the year but stay secure during a workout when I first use these earbuds I was initially disappointed in the sound quality but once Id got the fit just right they sounded fantastic so make sure to spend some time trying all of the ear tip combinations until you find the best fit for you for the elite sport the jabber spot life app unlocks a whole host of additional features transforming the earbuds into your own personal fitness coach the breadth of features here is astonishing from personalized training plans to automatic rep counting using the accelerometer to voice coaching you through a workout you can customize exactly what information is displayed or called out during a run and the app is definitely one of the best Ive ever used for fitness tracking the inbuilt heart rate monitor is also extremely accurate I tested these extensively and found them to always be within 1 or 2 beats per minute of my Apple watch the automatic rep counting also works surprisingly well and after using these for a number of weeks Ive yet to have any inaccuracies counting reps during workouts using the included win tips I found the earbuds stayed locked perfectly in place during workouts without so much as a hint of the moving let alone falling out within the app you can also access the other earbud settings such as the here 3 feature headphone readouts and the builtin equalizer I definitely would recommend adjusting this from the flat sounding default to the earbuds arrived with and I personally found this custom profile to sound the best but this will be down to personal preference we also have options here to share your workout data through social media and also to link the earbuds up with sports communities a unique feature to the elite sport is that if you ever lose of the Everts you can use GPS to locate them and even play a sound through the efforts to assist with location the abundance of features here is truly remarkable but how well these all worked was perhaps even more impressive I can definitely believe that the elite sports are in fact the worlds most technically advanced true Wireless sports air buds and these are probably the best sports ear buds Ive ever used the elite active 65 tees instead use the  __  resound Plus app here youll be able to customize your own quick toggle sound modes to suit different scenarios such as commuting a focus mode and an active mode again here you can access the hear through and readout settings but also customize both the music and call quality with the custom equalizer just as with the elite sport I would recommend changing this from the default setting the app doesnt have the same range of sports features as are available to the elite sports but it does include a builtin step counter perhaps my favorite feature here though is the included ambient noise sound board here you can select from a range of highquality ambient sounds but can really transport you to the different environments the perfect storm and cabin sounds were particularly effective and those who enjoy ambient noise whilst reading or studying can definitely make good use of this feature overall I would say that the active sixtyfive tees are geared more towards general use rather than being a clearly dedicated sports earbud like the elite sport I personally found that I can get a more secure fit into my ear canal then with the sports earbuds and I did find that these also stayed secure during a workout but on a couple of occasions I could fill the year but starting to slip and I had to press them back into position this really put into perspective the importance of the elite sports wingtips and without these I cant say it feel 100 confident trusting these to stay in my ears whilst out for a run looking at connectivity the elite sport uses Bluetooth 42 and I found that these gave me a line of sight distance from my phone of around 80 feet what do you think between the two earbuds was perfect and the latency was also not bad at all although as with any true wireless earbuds they are geared more towards audio than video and the audio delay from the image may be a little too great for some listeners the elite active 65 Ts use bluetooth 50 and although I couldnt make full use of this technology they did give a huge line of sight distance just shy of 100 feet again there were no syncing issues between the earbuds whatsoever and the connection in obstructed environments was particularly impressive the updated elite sport earbuds give four and a half hours from a single charge although I found this figure to be closer to five hours with everyday use the original model only gives three and a half hours so just check for the 135 inscription in the charging case or on the earbuds themselves to check that you have the updated model the case holds a further two charges for the earbuds which itself could be charged in just under three hours with the earbuds inside or two hours to charge only the case the earbuds also have a fast charge feature at a twenty minute charge will give you one hour of playback the 65 Ts hold a full 5 hours of charge which I found in practice to be just about right and the case holds an additional two charges the case charging time is the same as the elite sport and these also have a fast charge feature delivering one hour of playback after around 15 minutes of charging both sets of earbuds have a very similar sound profile the basin mid range is very good with the former being particularly impressive since this is where true wireless earphones normally fall short the base has a decent thump and complements the midrange frequencies giving an overall fullbodied sound the treble is quite even giving balanced vocals so only the overly bright songs may give you trouble with sharp s sounds I would perhaps say that the clarity isnt perfect and the sound can be a little muddy but using the custom equalizer and of course securing a good fit inside your ear will definitely maximize your listening experience to describe the differences between the models Id simply say over the active 65 TS have a much more refined and rich sound compared to the elite sport vocals a much more distinctive and the sound is fuller with greater detail I was also able to secure a better fits compared with the elite sport which definitely enhanced the audio the passive noise isolation is excellent so long as you can get that good fit and the sound leakage was almost nonexistent so these will be excellent to use in public places call quality was also very clear and the earbud microphones were particularly impressive especially since neither model features an overly extended microphone antenna both models picked up my voice really well and I never had to raise my voice to be heard during a phone call considering their size and weight the audio quality delivered by these earphones particularly the elite active 65 T was really impressive the convenience of these compact earphones is obvious but now that true wireless earphones can compete in terms of audio quality I cant see a reason why to use any other earphones or headphones on day to day basis if I were to touch on a couple of cons with these earphones that I would say that I would have liked to have seen some magnets to hold the earbuds in the charging case for that extra security Id also refine the control scheme with the elite sport and perhaps even the elite active just to make the buttons a little easier to press so that you dont risk pushing the earbuds into your ear canal an argument for touch controls could be made here on the whole long these were some of the best true wireless earphones that Ive tested and I definitely say that the elite sport were the best true Wireless sports air buds that Ive used with the wingtips providing that extra stability Id probably go for these if youre planning on using your earphones for exercising regularly the sixtyfive tees are definitely more suitable for everyday use but the superior audio quality and connection make these my choice for my daily earphones for light exercising or if you are able to get a secure fit the active model could be an excellent allround solution and with those small improvements these could be the better option for me Jerez elite active 65 t are the best true wireless earphones on the market but let me know in the comments what you think the best true wireless earphones are do these really beats Apples air pods or perhaps you prefer the bose or Samsung

to show you how you can connect up your Bluetooth headphones to a TV even if your TV doesnt have bluetooth so as long as your TV has a headphone jack then you will be able to connect up your Bluetooth headphones by just using a Bluetooth transmitter so this little Bluetooth transmitter was 18 UK pounds from Amazon and its really easy to work all youve got to do is youve got a pair this unit up with your Bluetooth headphones and then you just plug in the 35 millimeter jack into the headphone jack on your TV and then whatever comes through the headphone jack will go via the Bluetooth transmitter to your Bluetooth headphones and it works really well and its really easy to do now if this doesnt just have to work with TVs you can plug this into anything that has a headphone jack and it will then make the sounds go on to your Bluetooth headphones so its a really useful thing just make sure that you get a Bluetooth transmitter and not a Bluetooth 4 receiver because you are transmitting the sale from the TV outwards to the device such as your headphones or Bluetooth speakers or whatever you want to connect up so first of all we have to put it into pairing mode this is going to vary depending on the model you get but on this one is really easy all weve got to do is hold in the on button and then it will turn itself on we keep it held in and after about five or six seconds it will then go from blue light to blue red blue red blue red blue red and that means its in pairing mode and then on our headphones here we again we just turn them on and automatically when we turn them on theyre gonna look for the device to connect to so once youve done this initial pairing after that its really easy once they paired up once you dont have to keep pairing them you will just turn this on turn this on and they will just pair up automatically because it remembers the last device it was connected to but at the moment these are unpaired because I made sure I connected these Bluetooth headphones to a different device to unparent from this one here were just going to hold in the on and off button so Im holding it in now 1 amp 2 amp 3 amp 4 amp 5 amp 6 they so around about six seconds and you can see now it went to blue to turn on and now its gone blue red blue red blue red so thats now looking for a Bluetooth device were now going to turn on this one here again this will go on this particular one it will go blue red blue red blue red while it looks for a device so Im holding it in there there we go and now can you see theyre both going blue red blue red so now hopefully theyre going to be talking with each other and they will begin to pair so as you can see now theyre both paired up it took quite a while to pair at that time but from now on once theyre paired it should be quicker to do from now on so all we have to do now is plug this into the headphone jack of the TV and then we will hear it coming through the headphones so Im just going to take the TV off mute now you will see when I plug in the Bluetooth transmitter that it will then the sound will come away from the TV and start coming through the headphones so right now the sounds coming through the TV lets bring this camera over behind the TV right so on this particular TV Ive got the headphone jack just here so all we do is get your little Bluetooth transmitter and plug it in there now you can see the sounds gone away from the TV and if you have a listen on here theyre now coming through here and obviously you can control the volume and stuff via the TV and their headphones here so thats our full meal and if you want it a little bit louder just put it louder coming out the TV thats it now the only way to get the sound coming back through the TV again is to actually unplug the Bluetooth transmitter even if we were to turn off the headphones like Im gonna do now so theyre now off theres still no sound coming through the TV its only gonna work once we unplug this here and there you go you can see the sound comes through there now so lets just turn this off Veronica even if we were to leave that plugged in there it will still cut the sound to the TV even though this is now off now you get about seven hours use out of these bluetooth connectors before the battery dies but what you can do is if youre going to be using them a lot you can just plug it into the USB port on your TV because most of your TVs will have a USB port so you can actually charge it and use it at the same time so now you see the red lights on and its charging up every time the TVs on and you get these leads supplied with the Bluetooth transmitter now the next time we go to connect up it will work a lot quicker so lets say now its the next night and again you want to use your Bluetooth headphones because lets say your partners asleep and you dont want to wake them up while watching TV so lets now turn this one on here again this time we only have to hold it on for a couple of seconds till the blue light comes on so thats on there now and then again we hold this one on for a couple of seconds and now hopefully that should sync up now straight away okay so that looks to me as if its synced up so again lets take it off mute plug it into the TV just to doublecheck it swipe in here her career sadly but then taken over by Lauren Kieffer and there you go see country so here I sit and then when youre finished just take it out and its back on the TV again okay so thats it nice and straightforward thats how you connect up your Bluetooth headphones to your TV even if your TV doesnt have Bluetooth alright thanks for watching please give it a thumbs up if you liked it and please subscribe for more howto videos take care bye now", "video_title": "How to Connect Bluetooth

review of this real me but Wireless and these are the butts that Im wearing guys and Im surprised that they launched this so quickly because if you recall just last week I had reviewed the real me butts to review those are the wide ones ice Franky did not like the original ones but the butts  were a huge improvement but this really butts Wireless are their first one there are truly vollis and in terms of specs its actually really good and now they have actually launched this so we know the pricing its priced at rupees 1000 799 and for that the specs are actually pretty good and these are the buds this is the box that you get guys and from this when the packaging is really nice and you get this box and just such a big box you get this some paperwork gives you an idea about this you got a microUSB cable yes no USB typec but micro USB and some extra tips of gear pads and one is actually pretty attached so I just keep this to the side and to slide the box you pull this and it was packed in this obviously so the packaging was actually good size this came back to the side and lets look at this badge and now have used it for almost about five days guys so Ill give you my impressions what do I feel about this one what do I like and what are the things that I do not like and but first lets look at it and so these are the here buds and I dont know about you guys but this reminds me too much of the oneplus wireless Bluetooth earbuds the version 1 and the version 2 in fact if you look at this its almost identically the soft touch plastic that we have and even looks this is also magnetic so looks like they were inspired by them but luckily in terms of pricing they were not inspired because 1 plus bats cost almost two and a half  about three times compared to this one and this is again magnetic on this one but I like the fact that this magnetic connection is just not for name sake this has value in fact to shut off your buds you just do it like this and theyre off and to switch it on you just open it trying to connect to your produce a smartphone or whatever and if its the first time you are doing you should just remove it like this it automatically gets into the pairing mode so its very easy and to be fair guys I tested this one with three different devices I was actually retesting this pixel three except for Android ten so I use this a lot I would say 70 of the time with this one but I also tested it with iPad pro to see how it works with iOS and even with the real me Eckstein and in terms of connection I did not have a problem and the good thing is that these are actually Bluetooth five so in terms of the a signal that the signal strength was actually really good in fact if I could move beyond this room also to the next room it did not disconnect so the signal strength was very strong with pixel I took a lot of calls even when I was in other rooms I did not have any sure now again now you wear these like this and you put it in your gear like this and the microphone is also over here let me actually first give you a physical overview then we continue and here as you can see we have LED light with applause and stuff if you open this it will try to connect and if its connected will go and blue as as you can see its connected right now but you just put it like this black back itll say red and it just disconnects is and here we have the physical buttons plus and minus for the volume and you also have our logo which we use to pause and already say replay the music pause and play and if you hold it for more than two seconds what I notice is the activates Google assistance so that is there and here we have the microUSB port we using which you charge and really cream startled you get about 12 hours of battery life I simply could not test it there wasnt I didnt listen to it and you can see for that long but I would say the battery life is really good on this one and it can last for a long long time but in the last five days I had to charge it only once and they also claim that this supports sort of fast charging and fast charging and nothing is specified what is the voltage so I was charging it to the normal 5 volt 2 ampere charger that we are getting and a charge fine with that one so thats regarding the charting I dont have a problem and the microphone guys is also integrated in this one so as I was talking and if you notice this area again is that shot plastic so gives you that rubber soft rubber feel so its very comfortable to wear like this and you can just keep it like this and as its very light you dont even feel it there so in that way I would say its very comfortable and so now lets talk about the microphone because I did take a lot of calls with this one and I have to say in terms of the microphone quality they have done a very good job and I took a lot of calls with this one guys and none of the other parties complained that my calls were muddied or anything so the microphone that they have put fortunately is a very good quality one and you just pull it like this it connects so thats not a problem so let me actually show you right now Im wearing it as you can see and Ill just start this music and I can hear it but if I just take it out and put it that like this it will dispose the music and this will switch off so I like that functionality you just put it like this and its off and you just pull it pull this and its switched on and connects automatically to the last device and in fact in terms of connectivity also I did not have a problem as I mentioned the three different devices that Ive connected and if you have Bluetooth five then the range is also really good on this one so thats what I have noticed you just take this out and its very comfortable to wear and really also claims that these are sort of sweat the proof splash proof so if you do workouts and stuff also they should actually survive now lets talk about the sound quality because I feel thats the most important thing on a year phone and really claims that these actually have 112 mm driver this is the same driver almost the same size as the real meter buds too wide once hence I feel the basic quality is definitely a lot more emphasized and it has that punchy sort of pace which most of you would like so definitely the bass is elevated when the bass is there you do feel that but its done in a good way its not overpowering or it does not become so or powering that the dont get diluted now if we talk about the midtones there those are the vocals and lets say the people who are singing those are the midtones and here also I would say its done pretty good but it could have been slightly better so if I have to read for bass if a flow rate adulterated nine out of ten but for the midtones I would rate it 85 out of 10 now if we move to the highs these are the high tones shimmer here I would say my bias will come because I like your force that have slightly more treble emphases like JBL generally have that so that slight spark was missing but some people feel that if you have that excessive so what is a treble its a little bit tiring to the years so I will take the treble tones are good enough but again if you want that extra sparkle you wont find so in terms of treble tones I would rate it 8 out of 10 so overall if I have to talk just about the sound quality with this one I would say I would rate it 85 out of 10 but overall if you look at these earphones the build quality is good you have these magnetic connectors that actually work very easily switches on and off automatically pace to the last form and also the microphone quality that is good and even the battery life is actually really good and they actually feel premium in fact I would say if the color was black you and they dont have that are or logo over here you actually mistake this one what the one plus here but sir well this yeah was that do cost a lot more so overall I would say they are actually really good but they are two minor constant I have noticed with this one again these are sort of quibbles I would say the first con is that this one the charging port is still a microUSB port not a USB typec port and the second thing is that again this only comes as of now I know is only in this yellow color which is actually a little bit too loud for my taste and you have that yellow accent almost everywhere on these earphones so these are minor to quibbles but apart from that overall I would say if you look at the sound quality the comfort the goods microphone and also the battery life that you are getting then I would say overall I like it considering the price point of about eighteen hundred rupees I would rate it almost about nine out of ten so before we conclude I completely forgot to mention one thing when I was watching some shows on my iPad Pro and I was connected wired this one I noticed that there was a sync delay between the video and the audio the audio was getting on the seaair phones I was split second later and I noticed that so that is something you have to note but I noticed that issue with most budget oriented earphones and this one also has that and many of you have also asked me to actually compare this one with the me neck Bluetooth the earphone so what Ive done is these guys have just ordered it here you can see the screenshot and when I get it hopefully by next week or so I will do a comparison with this one and see which one is better and lets also put in the oneplus versus a bullet two wireless earphones because in terms of looks these are almost identical if these were black you might and if we dont have that our logo over here you might mistake this one for the oneplus bullet a Toria phones so once I get the me bluetooth what is a neck band earphones will do a comparison with this one so again stay tuned for that anyways guys thats it for now thanks for watching this is Ranjit and I hope to see you in my

this one plus Z farlis your phone so Im actually varying then and quite a few of you have asked me to actually take this outside which is this from what you say oneplus website already took it out here is it Ill show you this and comes inside this one this back here and if you open here we also have accessory box and some paperwork so you also get this USB typec cable with this one and some extra steps of earbuds as you can see so thats what you get so two pairs of extra ones and one is sort of pretty attached so total of three that you are getting and always do know its priced at two thousand rupees I feel the packaging is well done but one thing that is missing is that we dont get any pouch or anything in that and let me just close it close this one and give you an idea on the back it says that this has of wrap charge so if you are having the new one plus devices that have that wrap charge you can actually do fast charging with this one and they claim ten minutes of that will give you about 10 hours of battery life and in terms of battery life lets say its long battery life over here the battery life is actually really good they claim about 20 hours of battery life guys I started testing it yesterday I have watched about two movies and also finished about 45 minutes of listening to music and it was hovering around about 79 so the battery life is really good and it has that magnetic control it says just like earlier oneplus what do you say the bullet while this here phone just like the same these are magnetic and on of and on off is via that so if you just open it up it switches on so thats what it is and they also say waterproof its not completely waterproof I would say these are sort of sweat resistant so thats nice if youre even doing exercise and stuff a little bit of sweat or water splashes it should be fine and we also have a quick switch and we have the low latency mode I will talk about this one this is interesting they say that this is special mode that will work only with oneplus smartphones but I dont have the latest one class 8 devices so I tested it with what do you say the Samsung one and even a red my smartphone and I feel is actually good on this one so lets talk about it first let me actually show you these and Ill also compare it with this what do you say real me buds Wireless because these are not just about 200 rupees less than this one I also had it and many of you were asking me how does it compare so Ill also talk about that one but first lets look at this one and just like the original one Plus these are actually good this is made up of soft rubber and it feels very nice and premium we also have a select switch on and theres not a power onoff I would say this for switching between other devices Ill talk about this one later and we have the USB typec port again this one supports fast charging so thats actually nice and again we have a couple of controllers over here plus or minus for volume and if you want to take on end calls you have to use this one and it has an integrated microphone also and I would say lets first start out talking about the microphone and I would say the microphone quality is actually very good on this one others did not complain about the microphone and I had I took actually calls over about 25 minutes with this one and the other partys never complained so in that department is actually really good no issues regarding the microphone and even the Bluetooth range is good even when my smartphone was here and I was in other room moving around while taking calls never had an issue of disconnection so that way it is nice also the ear tips I would say as I told you these are magnetic so if you open it switches on and off and the here tips are also very nice and I would say in terms of comfort these are actually very very helpful table so in that area also you dont have to worry I was wearing it continuously for hours couple of hours as probably Ive watched a couple of movies with this one and never hurt it so very comfortable in terms of that and I would definitely say for 2000 rupees these are good ones and in fact I also have the original low one plus bullet violence if you guys recall this was priced at 6000 rupees and if you look at it almost the same in fact this one is actually thicker on these new ones I feel thats because of the extended battery life but for this one for 6000 rupees and like that the sound signature also I would say of the new one is far better than the original ones that were for 6000 now lets talk about what do you say other aspects of this one the Bluetooth range is good the charging speed is actually very fast and the battery life is also good and the microphone is also good so for a person who mostly uses this want to take calls and stuff like that that is good also before Ill talk about the sound quality and all these things let me also talk about the switching we have this button for quick switching and let me actually show you its actually paired with two devices right now this is my s 20 plus thats gonna be shown over here it is there and also Ill bring the show me this was the redmi note this also arent paid so let me do one thing lets just open this up and it should connect we have a LED light to this one as you can see its connected now its connected and it also shows you the battery life percentage right now its at a peepers and as Ive told you the battery life is kind of fake on this one it goes on and on and on so that way its very good now as you see if we have one physical switch over here and if you hold it for three seconds you can pair it with the new device but I have it was already paired to this one also this red me phone and if I just double tap this one its going to disconnect from this one and hopefully it should connect to this one oops and as you can see its connecting so it takes about one one and a half seconds so its very easy to switch between the devices by just pressing again as you can see its connected to this ready phone let me just double click this and it should switch back to this galaxy s2 ne and as you can see within the second it does and I dont have the latest of 18 devices its claims that the switching will be even faster its of oneplus device so that way I like this convenient switch let me just take this out now another thing is that about latency I feel the latency is controlled very well on this one as Ive told even while I was watching videos and stuff some of the Bluetooth headsets you get the lip synching issue here that was not the case I watch two movies on Netflix and was a lot of YouTube videos and theyre also I did not have that latency issue so in that way they have done a good job but as the box says with specifically oneplus devices it has a special mode to even reduce the latency so but in general mode with this galaxy s 20 plus I do not have an issue of latency so thats nice so in these aspects its actually really good but now lets talk about hows the sound quality on this one and here I have mixed feelings first lets talk about the good things if you talk about the higher tones here I would say 1 plus deck a very good job in fact the high tones have a lot of clarity on this one I would give it as high as 9 out of 10 and in terms of mid tones and the vocals also here I would say it was very very done and I would rate it again very high of about 9 out of 10 lot of clarity and vocals and the high tones and also in terms of soundstage I would say oneplus has improved the soundstage quite a bit I could easily distinguish the instruments as theyre coming from this side that side or when I was watching movies I couldnt distinguish easily where the bullets are flying so that way the sound State is also very good but now when it comes to bass I would say bass is there dont get me wrong its not like the bass is not there but if you are a sort of a person who likes a bass and many of the Indians do like that a enhanced bass here I felt it was slightly lacking dont get me wrong its not like the bass is completely not there or anything like that but I felt that the bass was slightly lacking on this one so in terms of bass I would cut down some points and I would rate it about six point five out of ten so overall a very good headset and in terms of music also Id really enjoy that but I did feel when watching movies and a lot of music tracks that the bass was slightly less then typically what we as Indians like so that was in terms of sound I would say and overall I would say I really like it for the fastcharging the microphone quality is really good so if you have that kind of a person for whom those are high priorities then I would certainly say that you like it now if I have to compare with this real me buds wireless I would say these sell for 1800 rupees and in fact if you look at it what are very similar in terms of obviously this doesnt have the USB typec port this has the regular micro USB and doesnt support as fast charging as this one not the battery as good but in terms of sound signature I would say the overall sound signature for music was better on this really buds because of that bass the bass gave a lot of depth so in that area I would say if you are a person who likes a little bit of extra bass in music you might prefer the real me over the one class but anyways overall I would say now at the price point of about two thousand rupees if you are looking for a good Bluetooth headset and music might not be your highest priority then I can certainly recommend this one because the sound signature has improved quite a bit the microphone quality is very good it has that insane battery life and that super fast charging so anyways what

overtheear headphones these sound true twos are the wired models while these sound link twos which I have here are the wireless both a complete redesign at least aesthetically having them a lot less bulky compared to last years model now pricing is on your screen with these sound link twos here that I personally paid for at the retail price of 279 and also through up there on the screen for another 20 you can get the wired but one of the best if not the best in active noisecancelling performance the bose qc25 for more recent updated pricing of course click on the link in the video description below just in case youre watching this later in the year again Im Jimmy with Jims review room be sure to subscribe and follow me on Facebook Twitter or Instagram for more reviews like this so Im here to help you make your purchase decision welcome everyone to jims review room going over the physical features first this is not a direct comparison video to the qc25 but i gotta say the selling tool looks and feels almost like them the same quality are placed into the selling twos with the foam band line with Alcantara a top has leather though and the arms extending down are reinforced with aluminum rails in BOCES fashion it feels like subtle simple and refined luxury but the quality is there to do my stress test nothing broke no seams were exposed everything really stayed together perfectly fine you do hear a little bit of play but nothing of concern at all overall very well put together now moving down to the air cups they do turn a full 90 degrees for stowing and they do pivot enough to fit most heads the unfortunately dont fold inward for easier stowing for travelers the supplied carrying case footprint isnt that large but it is something to take into consideration a little bit over 50 of the case is covered in fabric with the rest a soft leather inside this is felt lined with a neoprene carrying pouch for your supplied cables not worn them a little bit later but heading back to the ear cups here each side is labeled for easy channel identification the ear pads are just plush for longterm wearing but Ill discuss that in my comfort test shortly as for connections although this is a wireless pair of headphones the left side offers not a three and a half but a two and a half millimeter input and the cord provided is about three feet and 10 inches long just enough to keep your phone in your pocket the cord and input does not have a locking mechanism however attempting to simulate a yank or pull on the cord the water stays in very very well on the right side volume up and down with pause and play in the sensor which are very easy to reach a identify fiscally and the same sensor button can also be used to accept phone calls which Ill demonstrate real briefly here oh I am testing out my um these headphones uhhuh and I got you on the fundamental test in many ways how do I sound how does it sound so far its not like theres parking on your phone oh that clear huh yeah how nice and did you hear Lynn in the background you hear screaming oh now Im going to say do you hear an echo or any kind of static or anything like that no okay hey clear perfect alright let me stop the recording real quick several less features are the on and off switch on the side that also provides voice prompts on which devices youre connected to and the percentage of battery life remaining which is very useful in speaking of batteries the microUSB port is located on the bottom and Bose does a phenomenal job with offering quick charging 15 minutes gives you two hours of use while a fully charging the headphones from a dead battery will take you about three hours and you get 15 hours of playback better life is decent when I compared this to some of the other competitors out there other headphones were around 13 to 15 hours in battery life but as were comforts these are still the lightest pair of headphones that I ever tested they weigh exactly the same as the qc25 at just 69 ounces or 192 grams and because theyre so lightweight the minimal cushions and designs still works fine wearing these for three hours straight with no problems and it didnt have issues with the headphones clamping too hard on the jawline overall very comfortable as for sound leaking there is a bit though at higher volumes not too bad but compared to other headphones Ive tried the sounding twos do leak slightly a bit more but to the part that youve been waiting for the sound test overall similar to the other Bose products theyve always provided clean balanced audio right out the box is selling to provides a characteristic that leaned towards mainstream users not audio files in my belief some very much prefer the sound signature as it relatively remains flat not too strong on bass not too strong in the high notes either but its far from underwhelming as well the selling tools in my experience provides a neutral tone that works for many genres more so for classical rock andor other heavier vocal and string focused music the selling tos does work good for EDM hip hop and rap but those who listen to those generals I would think would favor a bit more bass to have that constant 808 beat in the background stand out a bit more but the sounding  offers clear sound virtually no distortion in its quality and listening to these for those three hours straight I had no listening fatigue whatsoever theres just enough bass to be enjoyed in general vocals are just enough Ford and highs are not singing in ear ringing for the price range the soundstage is decent with hearing Audio separation but distance isnt as well distinguished as some of the other highend headphones on the market overall if youre looking for a great wellrounded audio quality a great build quality thats super lightweight the sounding tubes are a great choice if youre looking for a better spatial sound deeper bass or something with a bit more bass boost theres definitely others out there as for the price let me know what you think below would you be willing to shell out just 20 more and go wired with the qc25 for the amazing active noisecancelling features Im really curious about that so I hope this review helped you in some way remember to subscribe and add me on social media at Jims review room on either Facebook Twitter or

102245248669", "video_id": "76N0cWwYrDs", "Closed Captions": " hey everyone Jimmy when Jims review room welcome back to another one of my videos today were checking out the Jabra elite 65 t truly wireless earphones has always been transparent with you guys jarba did send this as a reviewing it for us to test out for you guys as always were gonna be unbiased here please watch the entire video for both pros and cons prices are on your screen but Ill leave my affiliate links down in that video description below click on those links as theyll give you the most updated prices in real time you never know when these things might go on sale again Im Jimmy wood Jims review room and Im here to help you make that purchase decision welcome everyone to another review Music going over the physical features first these things are small and discreet for truly wireless earphones is pretty cool if you guys look at the video right now you can notice that it doesnt stick past my ears some truly wireless earphones sometimes they look a little bit gargantuan kind of unsightly as well if you were to compare this as reference then be you know eh Andy Samsung icon X 2018 edition looks pretty similar in size no these are all plastic theyre not made of metal they have this titanium paint finish which I think looks really good here but overall the finish is very much quality made well crafted in the buns are very clicky very tactile here and also very easy to reach now these are IP X 55 rated which means that it can take light water jet sprays here the office with my little spray bottle we didnt spray the crap on this thing and drench them and theyre still working perfectly fine now as for comfort these feel absolutely great the three ear tips included in the retail package works perfectly fine during running walking of course working here at the office theyve never fallen out of my ears I can wear this all day with no wind fatigue whatsoever now going back to the ear tips they provide excellent passive noise isolation you put these under the blocks on a lot of your environments forget about active noise canceling also theres a very minimal sound leaking at 50 to 60 percent amount which was more comfortable casual listening I even bumped this up to about 80 percent amount which is starting to get loud for us for these 65 Ts and just testing this here in the office barely anyone could hear discern what I was listening to awesome performance theyre now jumping into Bluetooth quality this is one of the very few truly wireless earphones that finally has Bluetooth 50 which is absolutely great for battery life signal reception etc now the test is posting myself here at the office with my samsung s A which does feature Bluetooth 50 and I was expecting a little bit more range basically but I did get 88 linear feet before these signals start to crack up now that is excellent if youre in the gym if youre walking throughout your house its gonna be no problem whatsoever eightyeight linear feet is typically on the highend Bluetooth signal range but because go to 50 I was expecting a little bit more but on that for most if not all average consumers idiot linear feed through a wall or two here at the office again it did but not only did absolutely great moving on here still sticking with Bluetooth signal I did test this with movies a lot of truly wireless earphones do have some kind of syncing issue where you hear the audio but then the lips on YouTube or Netflix is just going and flapping away I did test this again with my samsung phone here no problem with Netflix no plan with YouTube it is in sync one of the very few truly wireless earphones that has that feature or has that ability now jumping into battery life these do claim up to five hours with a battery thats pretty much on the average of truly wireless earphones it does come with a charging case you basically stick your earphones in here when youre not using them you stow them away and while theyre put a layer stowed away they do recharge they go which is fabulous which most truly around these earphones do again you get five hours on the earphones in themselves we tested this at 50 volume and actually got six hours and 45 minutes from full to debt again excellent in that regards the case itself does offer two full charges so in theory this gives you a full 15 hours if you need it quick recharging Ill basically put those stats on the screen pause if you need to if Im going a little too fast next up I want to talk about the speakerphone phone call performance and quality theres four builtin microphones into these earphones altogether this is a first I believe for truly wireless earphones this is something that Jabra its really promoting here it does pick up your voice crystalclear very audible its one of the best if not the best in microphone quality the only issue there the only caveat it picks up everything around you its someone thats ten feet away maybe a car driving down the road there me walking through doors to leave the building here its all picked up through the microphone in a very loud audible fashion I guess you can say now if youre in a quiet environment this thing works exceptionally well again its one of the best now the reason why has four microphones all together on these earbuds its not only just for speakerphone quality its because ive the very first truly Wireless earphones to feature Alexa builtin Im gonna call her Alexa from here on out so that way I dont activate your speakers at home but using this feature its very similar to lets say Google assistant or Siri on your smart phones those assistants works great the commands werent great the only issue that I found here when I did use Alexa is there was a slight delay the Alexa feature was a little bit longer it took like an additional second or two and as the even has an average consumer its something that you will notice I wish it was a little bit more streamlined or a little bit more intuitive or faster now touching base on audio these do get loud and I had to turn it up to about 80 Vaughn for the average consumer for most people actually eighty percent is not bad at all and this will be loud for you some people might listen to it a little bit louder some people may be a little bit lower now comparing to some of the competition like DJ bird runs or the Bose sound sport fries those that usually about 60 maybe the 70 vine is equivalent in loudest at 80 for these 65 Cs getting into bass these are more of a neutral level equivalent to the B note e8 so these do not thump or a deep and resonating like DJ Verve runs but I very much appreciated these because they are more of a neutral sound profile theres enough bump or thump that is enough for most general is very evenly well played it does not distort or basically hinder the midrange the jbert runs are very hard hitting the bose sound support fries are very deep and resonating cleaner based in the jbird runs but compared to these these are more compared to those other ones are a little bit more neutral now jumping into the midrange this is where it does shine here very good quality very good clean audio it doesnt have the same sound stage as the two other ones I have mentioned again the jbert runs or the bean or a vivo sound sport freeze that is but compared to lets say these Samsung I can X 2018 edition the drawbar 65 Ts do beat them theyre the midrange also does provide more of a neutral sound profile not overly bright its not necessarily Reece as well again for a neutral profile the high frequencies were never ear ringing ear tinny and never gave me listening fatigue no jumping into the application its pretty much straightforward pretty decent here you can adjust which assistant that you want whether it be Alexa again I dont want to activate your speakers thats why Im calling her Alexa but theres also a Google assistant in Siri builtin as well you do have an equalizer builtin which does slightly tune the audio characteristics a bit it wasnt as sensitive as the jaybird runs but compared to a lot of the other competitors either competitors dont even offer equalizer builtin and if they do its very minut here you dont really get a audio response so you dont have much changes also you have on here is the here through option or feature you basically can turn on the microphones and have audio in your environment pump into your ear so that we can hear your surroundings just for safety or just for caution as well so overall I highly recommend the dropper elite 65 tease the reason being I think they look great theyre very much comfortable the price point is very much reasonable for truly wireless earphones having the Alexa feature is a huge benefit a huge perk I did wish that it would function a little bit faster but just having it in general is something very much different compared to the competition out there the audio signature I believe was very good here its a little more a flatter profile thats not a bad thing it just depends on your preference alright folks so thats it for the review please be sure to comment down below

affordable Bluetooth wireless earphones and in this video well be doing the review Ill show you what comes inside the box and I purchased this one this is not officially available in India so I imported at Amazon and had to pay a huge premium for that three thousand nine hundred rupees Ill leave the link but I wont suggest you to buy from that in fact if it officially comes in India to be very affordable because in China its approximately about fifteen US dollars and yes there is also a xiaomi website on which it was listed for about 1900 rupees but i did try it and im putting two credit cards of mine but poor card declined hence i purchased this for review why i have a song so here are the eight dots and as you can see this is the chinese sir version so something greater than chinese and lets just open the scene over here so this opens like this and the whole thing actually comes out as you can see so these are the year birds and lets open it up and as you can see they are and this so nice to see that youre getting this case and lets see what else do we get so we can some extra ear tips that are available and thats it apart from and so i dont know why do they have such a big box because the other part was empty so this is what we get inside the box again the manual again this is in Chinese as you can see and for charging its actually a micro USB cable not typec guys so that is something that you have to note and these are their gear parts and we have some plastic over here left and right and some pins so this will also act as a charging holder and they are pretty compact as you can see so guys I have now actually used these a dot for the last couple of days and let me give you my opinion about it and the good thing is that first lets talk about the good things about this one the good thing is that in terms of sound surprisingly its actually pretty good for the price in fact I would say in sound signature it exceeded my expectations considering the price point of this one because Xiaomi already has this one the meets ports and this is sending India for about 1500 rupees and this air dots definitely sound better than this one so to summarize I would say first lets talk about the bass definitely the bass is emphasized on this one its not like a total bass heads or something like that the bass is there emphasized and I like what they have done with the bass its not  bumi or something thats very nicely done and now if you talk about the midtones where you have a lot of vocals and stuff here also I feel they did a good job the vocals are very clear so its great to listen to a lot of songs that have a lot of vocals now coming to the high tones I would say the high tones are very produced but they could have been slightly better but nevertheless considering the price point of these one and how compact they are I would say in terms of sound signature for the price I would give them nine out of ten now these are are truly Valis your birds they work on bluetooth bluetooth five I might restrict this with actually three different Android phones and they paid without any issues so in terms of the Bluetooth range also it was fine even when I moved to the second room it was intact it do not lose the connections so its difficult to the range I would say if you move from the second one room to the second room it will sound fine but maybe if you dont move to the third room it might disconnect but thats the normal thing that we have read Bluetooth headsets now in terms of comfort also they are actually really really comfortable and almost varied that they were just far out of my ears I didnt do any chalking or anything with this one as you can see Im just wearing it and if we just wear it like this and Target and theyve stayed secure I didnt listen to it continuously but I must have listened to it more than one when I know how fast continuously I didnt never fell out of my guess I dont know how good it will be for jogging and stuff like that but for regular use of your in your home and stuff they wont just fall out of your ears now moving to the battery life battery life strictly average understand these are very small as you can see and they have to house a complete battery in that I would say the battery life is what Xiaomi is sort of advertising thats about three and a half to about for us but the good thing is that this case also acts as the charge and this is how you actually charge it and you can put this back and this and we have some red LED lights that denotes if its charging and it can charge almost three times with this case so these are the good things about this one now lets prove to some of the cons that I have the first con that I have is regarding the build quality of the case from the looks of it it looks fine but one thing that what Ive noticed is the opening case of this one is very very verbally and it is actually clicking quite a bit as of now I dont know how well it will hold over time so this is my biggest concern about this one its really really wobbly so this might I am just a little bit fearful after two three months this might just come out and you really need this case for it to fur so thats one of my biggest concerns that I have with this one theres one area where I do not like these any dots and like most of the Bluetooth headsets you can also take voice calls with this one and you can do that even this a dot it has a microphone but I feel the microphone quality is simply not that great on this one because most of the times when I was taking cellular calls with this one connected to my smartphone most people complained that the call quality was simply not that great so that is something that you have to keep in mind now coming to another thing this is not specific to this for ordered but its availability in India as of now Xiaomi hasnt officially launched this one in India so what you have to do is you have to import it from China or buy it from Amazon I would strictly not suggest you to buy it from Amazon because I paid almost three thousand nine hundred rupees for this one and for that price I would say its really expensive but if you are able to get it for 1500 or be seventeen eighteen hundred rupees then I would say its a great pair of earphones and I hope Xiaomi officially launches this one India in China its selling for around thousand bucks I would say and India Ive taken even launched it for 1200 or even lets say 1500 bucks then it would be a great deal overall I would say really good pair of Valis Sega bats and certainly at this price point if you are able to get it around 1500 1600 apiece they are sort of a steal but I just hope that Xiaomi launches this one officially in time so guys thats it for now for

"collection_date": "20201007 102245248820", "video_id": "_IVYQuPzmo", "Closed Captions": " so todays video is sponsored by the company minimal case now Ive always been curious to why people go out and buy the latest greatest sleek looking design phones only to cover them up with those huge bulky cases so thats where the company minimal case comes in now they offer cases for the newest phones while keeping the phone looking the way it was intended to look now my personal favorite is the transparent case which basically looks like you dont have a case at all and thats the one that I have on my pixel for it so but they also offer colors in frosted white frosted black and matte black so theres no flashy colors they try to keep it simple which is the overall idea behind their cases now if you go to their site and use the code game ski you can save 25 off Im also gonna put a link in the description that if you use that it will automatically apply the discount when you go to checkout but Id like to thank minimal case for sponsoring todays video all right guys so today were gonna look at a pair of truly wireless earbuds from the company razor thats right the gaming company razor has now entered the truly wireless market and the pair were gonna look at is the Razer hammerhead true Wireless so to start with these armed 99 and they actually have the ear pod style design but they are offering some features that make these different than your normal truly wireless earbuds but lets go ahead and check out some of the specs and what comes inside the box now the first thing I want to point out is it does have bluetooth 50 so as far as lag and latency with watching videos I didnt experience anything there but the huge thing about these is it has a gaming mode which switches into like ultralow latency so as far as PC gaming and mobile gaming its going to cut down on you having like hardly any lag at all it says like 60 milliseconds and anybody that games knows how important that is the IP X rating is ipx4 I dont know why theres a pattern of this lately but IP x4 is at the lower end of the spectrum so yeah its fun for rain and sweat and stuff like that but as far as getting it anywhere near where you may drop them into water you dont want to do that but inside the box youre getting what they call a silicone ear sleeve so its not a silicone ear tip but I think its more people that want to go out and run and stuff like that and may have an issue with ear buds kind of bouncing or moving around in their ears this just helps keep it more secure but for me personally I prefer using these without the little sleeve now it also has a little strap that you can connect to the case that way if you dont want to throw it in your pocket or if you just wanted to use it to loop around something on your bag you have that option and so the charging cable they included is a really nice fabric USBC cable this is where some people are going to have an issue with these and I completely get it the battery life on these individually are around three hours that is really really low and then with the charging case youre only gonna get around 16 hours of use so as far as battery life thats some of the lowest that Ive seen in truly wireless earbuds now I dont know if the battery life is being affected because of the ultralow latency mode that they have or the fact that the case of these is extremely small so you cant really fit a large battery in these theres no excuse its a very small battery now the case on these like I said is a very small case its easy to throw in your pocket or your bag and just kind of forget that its in there you have a single indicator light on the front and then you have your USB C charging input on the back now the earbud design like I said is very similar to the air pod style not only because it has the stem design but also the earbud part itself has the exact same look as air pods so if youre already familiar with how those fit you will automatically kind of feel comfortable with these right off the bat now they are using custom 13 millimeter drivers which thirteen millimeter drivers in an earbud is pretty large the one thing Im sad to say right off the bat is they didnt use RGB lighting I know that sounds like a minor complaint but most of the time when Im buying Razer products I really like to have that little bit of glow or at least maybe that little bit of option of changing colors and I think it would have been a nice touch here now as far as your controls go these do use touch controls which controls everything but volume and again same complain as always I really wish companies would use volume control being able to just do it on the earbud themselves I mean you can summons your smart sistent its just not always convenient then the other thing that they added in these is being able to switch them into gaming mode which then immediately puts them into ultralow latency mode which is very vital when youre playing games now thats with your mobile device its with the PC and thats the convenience of these I believe I think the fact that they dont have any latency with playing PC games and then switching over if youre a mobile gamer as well it just makes it really convenient but to switch them you tap your earbud three times and you hold it on that third until you hear it say that its switching it in a gaming mode and to be able to switch it back you just do the exact same thing now the mics on these are actually very decent again thats important for gaming as well but I think that also is the reason they go for the ipx4 waterresistant because if it is anything higher it has to have more coding which ultimately would affect the microphone but you guys can be a judge by listening to a test here all right guys so here is a mic test using the Razer hammerhead true Wireless again I think this might picks up very very well and you can hear the details on my voice clearly and so here is the microphone with a crowd noise being played in the background so you can kind of get an idea of what it would sound like if youre using these in public so now lets get into the sound and before I get into the sound I want to go ahead and touch on the volume these get plenty loud especially on PC but even with mobile devices I didnt have any issue with thinking these needed to be louder and the other surprising thing is I found that even though these are the kind of just kind of sit in your ear I got a better seal with these than I have with others that have this similar style so the sound is surprisingly very clear while still having razors usual like impactful bass but it does feel like Razer cleaned up the bass a little bit because its not as sloppy as it is with some of their headsets now Im not saying their base in general is sloppy but they usually dont focus on tightening it up and these have more of a tighter impact hit which is great for gunshots explosions and everything like that these are really good for watching movies just as long as your movie isnt over three hours long now when it comes to treble the treble is bare detailoriented I dont feel like its pushed to that point of almost being too bright or too harsh it kind of sits right back about where the base does where they definitely have their presence but theyre not at the point where they feel like theyre just trying to do too much theyre not trying to take over theyre letting the mids do what they need to do this is a really nice overall balance truly wireless earbud but balanced in a way where its like still turned up in balance its not flat by any means now the one frequency I feel like they just really focused a lot on here and it really is the most important frequency when youre playing games are the mids the mids as far as singers go it always feels like theyre right there in front of you but with playing games you hear dialogue very well you hear footsteps really well everything is tuned in a way to bring out those subtle sounds I think this is what separates this product from other truly wireless earbuds you can really tell that this is focused on gaming but does an excellent job with music as well so as far as my cons with these I think the battery life being as low as it is is going to affect how people will approach these I mean three hours for some just is not gonna cut it the a px4 rating is another thing that just kind of makes some people leery about using these in certain environments and this may just be me but I really wish they would have included RGB lighting I mean I know some people dont like RGB but razors always been associated with that and so just to have your earbuds have that option would have been nice but overall for a hundred dollars this is an excellent media truly Wireless earbud it works great for games movies music sounds fantastic the soundstage sounds a little bit more open because you dont have the seal of silicon ear buds its not perfect by any means but it definitely ticks a lot of the boxes especially if youre somebody thats into gaming but guys this is my review of the Razer

"Closed Captions": " you hey guys its Kristin so in todays video Im gonna show you how you can connect your wireless headphones to pretty much any TV even if it doesnt have Bluetooth enabled or anything like that so now I ran into this problem where I started googling and doing a lot of research on how I could figure out a way to get my older TV connected to my wireless headphones and the reason for that is because my boyfriend works really early so he goes to bed early I work kind of later in the day so I go to bed later but I always want to watch TV cuz Im not tired but then Im always keeping him awake and so I was like theres got to be a way for me to like be able to hear the TV but not have him awake so I started doing a bunch of research and I found this cool device that allows you to connect anything any headphones that are wireless to a TV that maybe doesnt have the capability of like Bluetooth or Wireless anything like that so let me show you what Im using and how to set it up before we jump any further into the video if you guys are new please subscribe and then dont forget to hit the bell so youre notified when I upload a new video all right so this is the little device that I bought so its super tiny and it comes with a cord to charge this so this thing was like 23 bucks or 24 or something like that now if you look at the back of your TV some mines on the bottom sometimes its on the side up here but on the bottom this cord this little hole right there thats for our aux and thats what were gonna put this so Im gonna put this right in there there we go and then it just sort of hangs down but thats what were putting it right in there so one downside of this for this particular thing with the TV is that this is super short like its really tiny if youre using this for something else its fine but like for TV this really needs to be longer so on the back side and the side you can see theres like a power button so what were gonna do is Im gonna try to show this to you Im gonna hold this down and you should start seeing a blue and red light flashing so you want to keep holding until you see blue and red now Im gonna get my wireless headphones so now Ive got my wireless headphones and Im gonna hold this down until we see a blue and red light as well there we go so now you saw that both of them were on and they shut off and now this is just showing blue and this one here is just flickering blue as well so theyre connected so now that your headphones are connected you can be lying in bed or whatever youre doing you can have the headphones and even if the TV is like I think it was like Ive tested out and I was like 15 feet away you can hear it perfectly but nobody else in the room can hear you now this does work with other devices so if you have anything else that does not have Bluetooth or wireless capabilities you can use this little transmitter so that you can connect your wireless headphones one thing I always like to include in my howto videos is things not to do because I feel like people dont include that so then you make mistakes you know and if people give you a heads up then you can avoid those so one thing is you must have it connected to the TV like plugged into the aux cord or whatever in you know import before you try to sync it any time I tried to sync this just on its own like sidebyside it would not work and then as soon as I plugged it into the TV and synced it it worked just fine the other thing is that most TVs I mean if its new or it may not do this but the older ones which is what Im using this for if you leave that aux little device plugged in youll have no audio so if you like arent if your headphones are disconnected and youre like freaking out because the TV has no audio its probably because you accidentally left that little you know syncing device plugged in so you do need to disconnect it when youre not using it or your TV will have no audio and lastly I know that sometimes people can forget this I did one time it does need to be charged so like it only lasts so long so if youre in the middle of watching TV and all sudden you lose all audio and maybe the lights theres no like theres no lights and stuff its probably because you have to charge it so thats the only other thing I dont know exactly how long it lasts yet I havent really tested it but Ive been using it for probably like a month off and on and I havent charged to yet so on its probably gonna die soon but just those few things just want to let you guys know so that if you run into those problems you know why alright guys so thats it for todays video I hope you liked it and I hope this is helpful for you if you did like the video please give me a thumbs up also dont forget to comment below so that I know you were here and listening questions you had or if you found other devices that you thought work better also if youre new to my channel dont forget to subscribe and then hit this bell so that

the two so we decided to do this Beats Solo3 vs Beats Studio3 Wireless review Both headphones offer incredible Bluetooth range and stability thanks to Apples W1 chip The W1 chip also allows for seamless integration with iOS and iCloud But in terms of comfort we give the edge to the Studio3 The Studio3 Bluetooth headphones also offer better noise cancellation with their Adaptive Noise Cancelling Technology Finally the Studio 3 wireless headphones also offer better audio quality than the Solo3s On the other hand the Beats Solo 3 Bluetooth headphones are cheaper and we see more deals on them Next the Solo3 wireless headphones offer better battery life at up to 48 hours on a single charge which is pretty amazing Lastly the Solo3s are a little lighter and thus better for the gym than the Studio3 At the end of the day though both of these headphones are awesome Both of these headphones might land on the list for Best Wireless Headphones 2019 or Best Wireless OnEar Headphones

these are the bluetooth version at the 430 that I reviewed and really liked a while back and Sennheiser also has the 450 BT NC which adds active noise cancellation the 440 BT go for 150 dollars and Ill put a link below if you want to check out the current price or pick up a pair I really like the 430 so lets take a look to see if the 440 are worth it starting off with whats in the box besides the headphones you get an audio cable to use these as wired headphones it has a 25 millimeter plug on the headphone end and a standard 35 millimeter plug on the other you can turn and lock the audio cable to keep it from getting unplugged the audio cable doesnt have an inline mic or control so when these are plugged in they function just like normal headphones you also get a micro USB cable to charge some documentation and a fabric travel pouch the headphones are made entirely of plastic but they feel solid and well built theyre lightweight but feel durable and theres no creaking in the plastic theres the Sun riser name on the top of the headband and on the inside its lined with rubber with a small amount of padding thats okay though because these feel really lightweight and put very little pressure on the top of your head there are some hangs there logos on each side of the headband which is adjustable with clicks in each position and they can fold up too which is great if you plan to take these with you the ear cups are covered in matte plastic that is a nice feel but they do show oils from your skin not as bad as gloss plastic but you will notice some smudges the ear cups pivot up and down and will swivel left and right as I mentioned in the review of the 430 the ear cups are pretty big and I can see them out of the corner of my eye these also use the same leather at ear pads as the 430 which are extremely soft and comfortable but Im not a fan of the narrow oval shape theres a ton of padding and theyre very deep so the drivers dont press up against my ears but if you have larger ears then they fit very snug and can get pretty warm the extra cushioning and snug fit does block a lot of outside noise though I like that these make a nice seal around your ears one thing I noticed with the ear pads those how much oil they show thats not something I see on other headphones the ear pads are which is nice clamping force seems to be just right on these making a good seal and staying secure without putting too much pressure on my head these are very comfortable to wear for hours but they do get a little warm after a while all the controls are on the right ear cup from the left you have an LED indicator for power and pairing there are also voice prompts when you power arm on and make a connection and the female voice will also tell you when the batterys getting low next to that is the power button then the multifunction button you can press it in to play pause answer end a call or hold it down for 2 seconds to bring up Siri or Google now you can also slide it to fastforward or go back a track and if you slide and hold you can also fast forward or rewind then theres your volume headphone jack micro USB port to charge and mic there are actually two mics this one and then the one in the outside of the right ear cup the mic sounds great for voice calls the caller on the other end couldnt tell I was using headphones and you can hear your voice playback as well so you wont be talking too loudly theres NFC on the left ear cup for quick pairing so if you have an NFC enabled device just tap it to the logo and it will quickly pair otherwise pairing through Bluetooth is quick you can pair two devices at once so I was able to have my tablet and phone connected at the same time and play music from each without having to pair or unpair bluetooth performance is great too I was easily able to get a solid connection from one end of my house to the other and it only dropped out when I walked outside past 50 feet these also have aptX so if you have a compatible device youll get the best quality connection I dont have any aptX devices but I found these to sound great whether plugged in or Wireless battery life here is great as well youll get up to 25 hours its not as good as the 40 hours youll get with the Skullcandy crush your wireless or the beats solo 3 but its still better than most of the competition just like the wired version of these headphones these have a warm sound with some extra weight on the low end the bass is emphasized here but its not overpowering and it gives a good balance with punchy kick drums these dont give you the crazy amount of bass that you can get with the skull candy crush or Wireless or the sony MDR XB 950 bt but to me these give just enough of a bump in the low end to satisfy bass lovers but not take over completely Id recommend either of those head Bonz if you want a ton of ace but these are definitely worth a listen these have strong mids as well theyre rich in clean and vocals have a good amount of presence the highs are detailed and clear but they arent as bright as I personally like but they sound good at full blast and they dont get harsh these have a nice wide soundstage too with good stereo separation they sound great for a wide range of music whether listening to bass heavy tracks or not and they sound great for movies too the bass gets deep without distorting or drowning out the dialogue I really like the way they sound they have an accurate sound overall with rich bass that seems to be just the right amount for me and again you can get wireless headphones that have more bass but these are still really fun to listen to so that wraps it up these sound great with nice deep bass theyre lightweight and they feel really wellmade I like that these have NFC for quick pairing and the battery life is great too even though everythings plastic here they dont feel cheap my only nitpick with these is the ovalshaped ear cups they do feel a little cramped and get warm but theyre still very comfortable theres a link in the description below if you want to pick these up and let me know if you have any questions in the comments below hit the like button if you liked this

earbuds from Skullcandy now weve already looked at the Skullcandy Indy and the Skullcandy push which are their other truly wireless earbuds but today were gonna look at the Skullcandy sesh its a pair that comes in at 50 dollars and if youre like me youre probably wondering what they had to cut to get it to that price so what were gonna do is start with whats in the box and some of the features now it does have bluetooth 50 it is IP 55 sweat resistant and water resistant so its not something you can submerge into water but if it gets splashed or you sweat a lot its gonna be okay now inside of the box it comes with small medium and large silicone ear tips and it also comes with a micro USB cable alright so were just gonna go ahead and maybe stick with thats one of the things that they were gonna cut cost on because other than that I dont understand why they used micro USB now battery life on these this is gonna be one of the things that turns a lot of people off individually they only get three hours which is really really low but if youre somebody that just uses them while youre working out or somebody that just kind of uses earbuds intermittently it wont be a huge deal but if youre somebody that likes to use earbuds pretty much your whole day this is gonna be very inconvenient youre gonna have to charge it like three times just to be able to make it through the day now the charging case will give you up to ten hours total again that is on the very low end of the spectrum so the battery life is going to be a huge turnoff for a lot of people now speaking of the case the case has four indicator lights on the front to let you know what percentage of battery life your case is left at and then on the back you have your micro USB input now on the front of the case you can see where Skullcandy is just simply written up top again the case is actually really nice now when you open the case again its really clean and really simple and you can see that your buds now I do want to point this out because this is something I was having an issue with when you put the earbuds in the case youd think it just kind of falls right into place and it really doesnt you put them in the case and you actually kind of have to Whittle it just a little bit to get it to fit in the case right or otherwise the tops not gonna close and its not gonna charge them but youll know that it doesnt go in because the lid will not close until you have it in the right way so now on to the earbuds themself as far as size this is one of the smallest pair of truly wireless earbuds Ive seen which I know is contributing to the battery being so small but again I would have taken it being a little bigger just to have a little bit more battery life but I will say this these stay in your ear extremely well and again theres no weight so you can pretty much do whatever and they are not coming out but as far as controls go it is button control and its not touch responsive the button actually responds pretty well so its not one of those where you feel like youre jamming it into your ear and the button actually controls everything your volume your track control your smart assistant everything now if you are wanting to use one of the earbuds individually youre only able to do that with the left ear bud so another thing thats pretty important to a lot of people is the mic quality now this is one thing I will say that I was not a huge fan of now mic quality is not a huge deal to me but for those of you that it is important you might want to listen to this test alright guys so here is a mic doesnt the Skullcandy says this is also while playing a crowd noise in the background you definitely feel like this is one of the things they cut on to get to that 5000 right there all right so now we need to get into the sound quality because honestly the Skullcandy Indy and the Skullcandy push has not really won a whole lot of people over so the sesh I was kind of expecting alright this is 50 I dont think theyre really gonna do anything to improve upon their sound and I was actually surprised this sound on these yes just like in Skullcandy fashion does have plenty of bass but whats weird about it this time is it kind of has an eerie sound it kind of has a fairly open sound but dont get that confused with thinking they sound like the sound stage is really open its not that soundstage is fairly narrow but with the bass it just seems to have a little bit of air to it which is actually kind of nice the other two frequencies though the trouble comes through really clean and really clear but the mids are the one thing I think at times just feel like they need to be pushed up just a little so its more of a different kind of sound signature than a lot of people are going to be used to and another thing that kind of caught me off guard is usually most truly wireless earbuds when songs that are chaotic or songs that have a lot going on the bass usually just rolls through everything else well these are kind of the opposite it seemed like when there are songs where a lot of stuffs going on the bass just kind of toned down a little bit to where the mids and the treble still had presence and the bass is still there but its not as prominent when it comes to some of those genres or some of those songs that just have a lot going on so the weird thing about the Skullcandy sesh is theyre 50 bucks okay the other ones I think the Skullcandy push came out at like a hundred and thirty and then the Indies are 80 so theres a huge price drop coming in at 50 but the surprising thing here is the Skullcandy sesh is actually the better sounding truly wireless earbud out of the three it has the most volume it has the most clarity bass is good but its definitely not overwhelming and its just an overall pretty satisfying truly Wireless earbud to use and for 50 the sound is exactly where it needs to be especially with the holidays coming up where a lot of kids are gonna want truly wireless earbuds and then a lot of kids are gonna be drawn to companies like Skullcandy apple and you know the usual so for Skullcandy to have a 50 pair going into the holidays is actually a pretty smart move the guys that is my review of the Skullcandy sesh thank you so much for checking out this video thank you so much for checking out all the other videos and as always make

review of these me wireless headphones and these are the new super bass headphones that quite a few of you have asked me to check it out so here we have it and now have used it for some time so Ill give you my opinion what do I feel about this one but first lets look at these headphones you get this in this fancy box and it says that it has about 20 hours of playback time and I wont actually test it continuously for that long but definitely the battery life is one of the big strengths of this one and it also says that it has that 40mm driver and it is bluetooth 5 and these are the headphones it says and they look actually pretty fancy from the looks of it as you can see it looks a really really good but one thing I have noticed is that the build quality is very very plasticky and clicking and the quality of the plastic actually feels a little bit on the cheaper side but the good thing is that it has a little bit of padding over here and again even though your cups have a good cushion and as you can see it says left and right over here so thats not a problem but again I felt that the plastic quality is actually on the cheaper side so youve got to be careful with this and definitely not for rough users as it can break and these are again 40mm drivers are running to Xiaomi and if you notice the right cup actually its mount right and left over here the right cup has everything on the bottom if you go we have the micro USB port that will be used for charging we also have headphone line out so you can actually use it with audio cable that is actually provided in the box so if the battery dies you can technically use it and we actually have now three different buttons the first one is for the power on and off and other two buttons are for the volume and you can also skip tracks with that one so thats the physical overview of these headphones but lets now first talk about what do I feel about them and first lets talk about the Bluetooth range and as its a Bluetooth 5 headset Im happy to say that the Bluetooth range is actually really really good on this one even when I moved to the other room it did not disconnect so in fact in terms of Bluetooth range I was actually pretty impressed with this one compared to most of the budget oriented headphones in this range this one has way better Bluetooth range it also has integrated microphone so if you wear it you can actually take calls with this one and I did take quite a few calls with this one and Im actually disappointed with the microphone of this one most times the other party said that I was not sounding clear or I was sounding a little bit on the weird side equation stuff like that so in terms of what do you say if you are primarily you buying this for taking a lot of cellular calls then I would say its great I would read it just five out of ten if I have to rate it based on the Bluetooth cause I feel the microphone quality is simply not that great now if we talk about the battery life as Ive mentioned the battery life is really really good again it will easily last for a couple of days even if you suffer heavy users Xiaomi claims about 20 hours of battery life on this one also I like the fact that you have that VAT connectivity if you really want that you cant and do that now but lets talk about the sound because I feel for headphones the biggest most important thing is the Sun but before that lets talk about the comfort also in fact in terms of comfort if you forget about the build quality as I mentioned earlier I feel these are actually pretty comfortable on a year because of this cushioning that it has its actually very comfortable to wear and you can wear it for a couple of hours yes your gear will become slightly on the warmer side but again thats the same thing with any headphone so in terms of comfort if you forget about the build quality yes theyre not sort of comfortable but now lets talk about the most important part that is sound and as the box says these are super bass and yes definitely the bass is actually highly emphasized on this one and I would say it is over emphasized a little bit and hence the bass definitely sounds a little bit on the muddier sights the bass in fact creeps into the vocals also hence the vocals also get slightly muddied I feel so in terms of I would say bass I would rate at 75 yes you do get that depth and if you like that heavy bass you get that bass but again the bass is not very clear and punchy so it gives that mellow feeling I would say and even the vocals get slightly drowned due to the bass and if I have to read on this one the vocals also dont sound that great the vocals sound a little bit subdued I would rate it about lets say 7 out of 10 in terms of vocals now coming to the higher tones here also I felt that these were sort of lacking and that some of the instruments that we have on the higher tones were very subdued on this one and definitely because of that the it didnt sound punchy to me in fact in terms of treble tones and stuff I would rate it just about 65 out of time so overall I would say if we are just talking about this sound quality on this one I would rate it just about six point five out of ten I expected a lot from this one but in terms of sound department apart from the bass it was slightly under disappointing sight for me but I mean the good thing is that it does have great battery life and also in terms of Bluetooth connectivity it was very good but still overall I would say for me the sound is the highest criteria and also the build quality is pretty average hence my overall rating would be six point five out of ten and the cells in India or 1800 rupees and I purchased this via Amazon Ill leave the link but I feel frankly the block point be at zero one these sell for about seventeen hundred rupees in terms of build quality these are actually much better than the me and also in terms of sound quality I feel these are slightly better anyways guys that was my review for this me super bass headphones if you guys are still not subscribed to my youtube channel hit that subscribe button and many of you might also ask me what about the means port bluetooth headset those are not headphones I definitely feel that the me Bluetooth the headsets that sell for about 1500 rupees are do sound better and this one anyways guys thats it for now for this

how it matches with the iPhone because this is important to the matte black looks beautiful together so they come in a bunch of different colors whatever color iPhone you got youll be able to get the matching set of headphones this is part of the experience of buying beats not necessarily 100 for the sound you buying it for this you got your nice Apple watch your iPhone you want to keep everything

ok now this just popped up solar to reconnect hit the button now its connected just like that that might even be faster than NFC I dont know we have to do a little speed test 100 percent battery alright now for the most important part the sound test lets take it to some music lets see what we got on deck today what was I just listening to I just wrote lets throw some drink why not DJ Khaled and Drake here we go another one hashtag another one lets get maximum volume alright I hear the song right and nothing right now Im putting these on here we go here we go whoo okay here we go I must have the super powers cuz Im off a CC and and Im off the Hennessy you know this deck aint free oh the bass is knocking on these stay another day for attitude or not nah you  __  Akbar your stomach on flat flat and you your  __  whats that if yall know the words man lets go youre the only one no can fit it all enough little wonder if you ask yourself is it just me is it just me this sex so good I shouldnt have to fall for free is it just me is it just me they say so good I shouldnt have to  __  for free okay up to a top your life alright now let me stop being a high beast who these dudes sound good but for 300 bucks these headphones that sound better i diss headphones that sound better but you gotta remember when youre buying these beats headphones like the countdown I gotta got the right Lola when you buying these headphones its not just about buying the headphones because honestly for 250 bucks you could get these right now let me show you the difference alright you could get these blue teal UFO pros all right now these are going to run you 250 and they sound better Im just being honest with job they sound better theyre a lot bigger theyre a lot bigger hmm bill quality is a little bit less you know a little bit more flimsy up you know big UFO branding on it blue the old branding on it nobody really heard of these but they sound better they sound better these sound pretty good though alright now if I was putting the price tag on these I would be comfortable paying 200 bucks for these 300 a little bit extra but at the same time this is what youre paying for at you paying for that beats logo youre paying for that that Apple pairing and youre paying for the name and the brand now look I know which I hate is gonna say I know I already know here we go yo why bought beats beats ugh you could get the Sennheiser HQ old fours you could get the Audio Technica 108 ms wide by the beach I know I know hashtag I know look its not always about buying headphones or buying anything specifically for the sound or for that purpose sometimes you buy stuff for a fashion accessory so most of the time when you see somebody rockin beats they already know that theres better headphones on the market for cheaper they already know that but they dont care about that they want the beats because you seem LeBron James rocking these you see Nicki Minaj dj khaled you seen all the Olympic athletes rocking these you want to be part of the beats the whole beats ecosystem the act the Apple ecosystem you know you want to be fashionable and theres nothing wrong with that I get tired of arguing with people every day its nothing wrong with that all right if you get up and you go to work you pay your bills you pay your taxes you take care of your family now you got some money left over and you want to buy some headphones you could buy these for 250 if you want theyre gonna sound great or you could buy some of these and be a boss now when you hit them all and youre walking around with these on everybodys going to know you that dude that you that dude you got the Apple watch iPhone got the new beats solo threes on you doing it now you come through with these on you might know they sound better than beats but everybodys going to be like whats those yo what are those alright and I get I give you I give you a quick example Ill give you a perfect example the videos over but Ill give you a perfect example look you could go out and buy these right now all right well talk about sneakers because its the same thing you could go out and buy these right now for 50 bucks 50 bucks a nice set of quality sneakers put them on wear them do what you got to do all right 50 bucks or you could go out and buy somebodys you can buy some of these for 250 whats the difference they both leather sneakers they both got a sole they both going to protect your feet they both got shoelaces they both probably made in Taiwan or somewhere whats the difference the difference is when you rock these gonna be saying water those and when you rock these youre gonna look like a boss thats the difference and like I said this theres nothing wrong with that theres a time and a place for everything when Im going to work I come through with the Pumas on I come through with the blue teal headphones on not a problem but if Im going to South Beach and I know Im about to be in the airport I might need some P Y tees up in Jamba Juice might meet a nice little thought on the AirTrain I want to have on a fresh set of Js my Beats headphones fashion statement I so if you enter fashion statements and into you know quality stuff you know you want to be down with the incrowd and all that nothing wrong with it nothing wrong with that overall on a scale of one to ten I would say I would say these are definite go the price is just a little bit Savage I wish the price would have been 250 you know maybe 200 250 which they will drop eventually they brand new so youre gonna pay that 300 a will drop eventually but they all go they do sound nice I was getting hight listening to the music the bass is heavy matter of fact yall want to try it lets try arm lets try to wired connection and see how that sounds a lot of times these headphones they dont sound the same wired as they do Wireless now why would you want the wire simple if the battery dies and you dont have a charger then youre going to want that wired connection oh no headphone jack I let me pause the video real quick I got to grab my adapter hold on alright so I had to grab my little adapter I said well plug this in alright so its on lets see how it sounds waiting for that bass drop you know what it is when you signed up now you got to run it up bass drop oh okay alright I go front these do sound good now they sound good actually I would say they sound better Wireless but they dont they dont take a big hit when you plug the wire in so you can rock these Wireless or wired and theyre gonna sound good my only gripe price is a little savage but they do look hot I aint gonna front these look hot yeah Im definitely listen to this little gloss in there okay yeah I so this is this a nice little combination right here anyway so just a beat solo Wireless three special edition black hit me up in the comments let me know what yall think about these and let me know if yall want to do a full headphone comparison of all over the wires who are wireless ones I got now let you know which one is the best shout out to everybody that rock with me on Facebook Foursquare Twitter Google shout out to all the

and now we get this topdown look that you guys have here and Ill continue tweaking it to make it look better over time but well work with this for now so today Im showing you my test for the sennheiser momentum true wireless earphones that means theres absolutely no wires with these things Ill place my affiliate links down in that video description below for you to get the most updated prices in real time do you never know when these things might go ahead and sale also full disclosure here Sennheiser did send these over for review but my assessment was not altered in any way Ill be going over both pros and cons Im Jimmy with Jimmys review room and Im here to help you make that purchase decision welcome everyone to another review Music all right folks going over the physical features first the earphones are mostly hard plastic with the Sennheiser logo in very much Sennheiser fashion shiny metal with texture and it does help to make this look and feel a bit more premium than many other more sport oriented truly wireless earphones out there now one thing that I will met though shes a bit thick and I dont mind thick but for earphones compared to many of the other competitors you can see its just ever so slightly bigger Ill preface by saying everyones ears are a little bit different and from my personal use in the office to walk around the Sennheiser do stay in the ears perfectly fine if I choose to run with these thankfully they dont fall out either but if you decide to run with these they dont provide that level of confidence like the jbird run XT is the Jabra 65 Ts and the others because I do notice the Sennheiser is just ever so slightly pulls a little bit forward for some reason its a very minut sensation is not an issue though like I said Id never fell out of my ear but it is something to take notice if you do own these let us know down in that comment section below for your experiences it does help others with any Jims review room community now going over the physical controls their touch sensitive gently tapping or holding either earphone down trigger some sort of action for example holding down the right side of my earphone gradually raises volume while holding the left lowers it down heres the list of all the buttons on your screen feel free to pause the video if its going a little too fast here now the only thing that I would warn them if you are to readjust your earphones like Im doing right now to make it more comfortable or the hard time you may trigger Siri or Google assistance or accidentally pause your music now after a day I was used to the earphones and then I stopped touching them in general though the earphones do provide very good passive noise isolation not to mention very minimal to almost nonexistent sound leaking but if for some reason you dont want to black out the world Sennheiser does offer transparency mode now with a double tap on the right earphone like so their microphones turns on and picks up the audio in your environment now you can use this for safety reasons or if you want to hear what going around you at work here now most other air phones do amplify your surroundings so you get superpowers that is like being able to hear better than what your ears arent normally capable of with these Sennheisers its conservative compared to the competition it sounds the most natural it doesnt sound artificial which I dont mind at all actually really do appreciate but if you have music going on and transparency mode is activated you have to play music quite low to hear your surroundings at the same time keep that in mind now moving on the momentum truly wireless earphones are able to take phone calls from my personal testing its one of the clearest in the office when youre around a quiet or maybe medium amounts of noise it doesnt block out everything but it does bring my voice to the forefront and in those quiet to moderate noisy areas it does suppress the background a pretty good bit here now in busier areas unfortunately just like most earphones here it does pick up background noises more noticeably but again for these sanitizers it is one of the better performers out there now as for Bluetooth technology the momentum true Wireless uses Bluetooth 50 so thank you sanitize it for free to proofing this thing basically the common issue though Ive seen on previous brands where times the left earphone doesnt sync with the right earphone no my testing over the weeks that Ive had this I personally didnt have that issue now the other thing the June preview community is quite large now but every time I review one of the things someone always asked me if they can leave one earphone in and the other one off with these Sennheisers I can leave only the right one in and I can take off the left one put in my pocket or so now if I swap them out only leaving the left ear bud or earphone technically in it doesnt work if this is a musthave feature for you I am reviewing the jbert XTS most likely next week and you can use either one of them in your head in your ears that is but getting back to you the Bluetooth testing with video Netflix and YouTube played fine with lips in audible dialogue performing in parallel I do recommend that you use these for movies when you get a chance they do sound pretty damn good here and last about signal strength Bluetooth technology bluetooth strength Im able to walk 50 linear feet away from where I place my phone in the back of your studio I walked out into the hallway 50 linear feet isnt so bad most average consumers thatd be perfect we find but compared to competitors Im getting usually a little bit better performance last before I talk about battery test these are ipx4 rated meaning you can take a splash of water from any direction now I dripped water on this thing here from my water bottle and its still working fine for my test if you want protection from water sprays or literally literally this drop into a puddle of water and its still fine then you need I pee 5 or higher most people are okay with IP 4 meaning if you get caught in the rain you should be protected with these 10 hyzers you just cant submerge them in water now moving on the case itself is very nice I personally love the fabric look here let me get this secret product Im be reviewing pretty soon here I havent seen where over the past month or so of testing bees theyve been in my bag but pocket rubbing against other things that I carry and it still looks really really good also side notes theyre magnetized and does a very good job of holding these earphones in the case as you guys can see here drop jump drop nothing so getting a closer look lets take a look at the back here sennheiser is using USB typec thank you for future proofing once again the case itself provides an additional eight powers of power the ear phones themselves provides up to four hours of use so with my testing at 50 vine Im getting on average 3 hours and 40 minutes from a full battery to dead so that sums up everything physical about them going over the physical features as well so lets get into the audio experience now I have one or two truly wireless earphones that I need to test out and then Ill be doing my top 5 video pretty short here but for the time being I can tell you that these Sennheisers are fair in quality starting with bass these jaybird XTS which is the other one that I again am testing at the moment as slightly a bit more bass but for somewhat relative comparison you can tell that the Jaybirds are actually a little bit more bass boosted I dont mind that sound at all I really like it but these Sennheisers are bassy but not artificial in my opinion theres no question enough thump punch Hecker enough bass that makes any genre pop Edie Im hiphop you name it its clean and it gets my head nodding when I have vine bumping at boss five percent the vocals are distinct the key word here is very balanced across the board I could use a little more brightness or treble on the upper midrange to make this sparkle a bit more from the factory settings but we can fix that with the app which Ill detail very soon now I think one of the highlights is hands down these have a wide soundstage audio separation depiction of every instrument beat vocal performance its all there the midrange has good resolution detail again being wide indistinct its a very good experience overall as for the high frequencies its never been ear piercing never over reaching or crackling again it could use just a little bit more than my personal opinion but here let me take out the app here and this has improved it for me let me show you alright folks lets take a look at the app as always being transparent with you guys the app was somewhat finicky at first I would be paired via bluetooth with my phone and the earphones functioned perfectly fine I was able to play music use the functions on the earphones themselves no big deal at all but the app itself for some reason could never see my earphones after probably about three days of messing around with it there was no updates during those three days but eventually the earphones started working and theyve never faulted or never had issues since then so since its been working you do get battery life which you can see here transparency mode is right below and right down there is the equalizer now although the equalizer at first looked a little too simple for my taste Im honestly used to multi band adjustments and such but after using this the very subtle changes and the adjustments do work one side basically affects the other and keeps the audio signature relative so overall you really have ever user error or you cant really just mess us up in any way of form and on screen heres my setting I usually leave it like right around here and where it is right now compared to the stock setting it sounds a lot better just right around there so so last but not least let me open up these settings here and back out and go here so in the settings in the menu you get smart pause which means that whenever you take off your earphones music will pause automatically for you thats an awesome plus then we have auto accept phone calls and then voice assistant access which is pretty much selfexplanatory so my entire experience here its been a very positive one if I had to critique it would be this sighs I wish there was a slightly a little bit better battery life and honestly I wish more wireless earphones would include this but its fine my ear phone action within the app if I drop one of these down on the ground or especially when Im outdoors it would be nice if these can be pass ignore maybe on the phone it will review the GPS I dont know Im not an engineer but for the price though I think thats a really big deal in my opinion and speaking of price if you guys can afford these highly recommend that you guys can give them a try most of my viewers I would probably say wait for them to go on sale and then definitely definitely check them out I think these you should not miss at all again Im Jimmy with Jims

were going to take a look at the beats x wireless headphones now you can buy these from applecom ill throw the link up in the description the price 150 bucks now by the end of this video im going to answer the main question that everybody been asking me all week should you buy the beats x for 150 bucks or should you spend the extra 50 and get the powerbeats 3 now im going to go out on the limb and say get the powerbeats 3 but well put them to the test all right so lets check these out the beats x 150 bucks now these are available in a couple of different colors lets check out some of the features wireless bluetooth battery up to eight hours wireless play now these also feature fast fuel now in my opinion thats the best feature about these headphones what that means is you charge these up for five minutes and you get two hours of battery so if these are completely dead all you have to do is charge them up for five minutes and thats going to give you two hours worth of battery that is insane and trust me its not a gimmick it works the same on the powerbeats 3 these are the kind of headphones that if youre using them for the gym youre never going to have to bring these in the house get yourself a little portable power bank and charge your headphones in your gym bag or when you get to the gym just plug in your headphones for five minutes while youre changing your clothes and you got two hours battery thats plenty of time for a full workout you got removable secure fit wing tips flex foam cable and control music and manage calls all right so 150 bucks lets check these out get your little arrow right here lets open these up okay now if you ever bought anything from beats you already know beautiful presentation talk lists and beats okay why not heres your headphones lets see what else you get try not to activate beast mode just came back from the flu shout out to everybody that wished me to get well i appreciate that great sound starts with proper fit so you got a bunch of different wing tips lets lets check them out now okay wait whats this hold up free apple music okay let me activate that before yall get it oh you got your beat sticker all right you already know what to do with this anybody that has j birds or fresh eat buds or any kind of other headphones you take this beat sticker and you troll them with it i like that usual books and pluck them follow them to the side some more safety information it is what it is okay now this is a real nice presentation for 150 bucks you expect that this is going to be your carrying case okay let me do the smell test on this smells like velvet you got your little beats insignia on it its definitely a matte finish on this so no fingerprints shout out to xerxes back in the building now this is one of those cases that theres no closure thats one thing i dont like no closure you just squeeze it just squeeze it and drop your headphones in and keep it moving now i personally like stuff like this better you see this way you could put all your extra wing tips put whatever you got your cables zip it up and youre good but youre spending a little bit less so youre getting a little bit less with the presentation case is a little bit more suspect lets see what else you get now heres your cable this is usb to lightning all right so this is the first set of beats headphones that have lightning instead of micro usb all right thats kind of cool different size ear tips we dont need to go through those and different size wing tips all right so well play with those now i tend to go without the wings but well see and thats pretty much it for inside the box look out xerx and heres your headphones lets see do they come with wings on them i no wings originally so youre gonna have to add them on ill test these with or without the wings okay all right so here we go back up zerks back up lets take a look at these heres your uh trolling so hard heres your power button okay soft silicone filled to these now these have your magnetic ear cups okay you see they stick zerk zerks back up please please please look she just want me to touch you alright sorry im gonna touch you okay look im touching you now just chill now these have magnetic ear cups so if youre wearing these around your neck theyll still stay magnetized like this now these definitely got a little bit of length on these look how long these are all right these are super long just to give you a comparison let me grab the powerbeats three and well see dont eat those zerks and ill show you the difference in the length now heres the power beats three zerks back up oh i cant all right now look at look at the difference all right heres the powerbeats three we can lay those right on the table and look at the the difference in the length okay so major length difference that could be a good thing or a bad thing for me i dont know well see a little beast brandon on this now these are flexible material i like that heres your lightning charging adapter right here your slot i know all right so well plug this in lets see if we can charge these up real quick this is one of my favorite new little power banks plug this lets turn this on okay lets see if were getting any charge on these lets look for some wheres the led at on these all right um dont see the led but im under this bright light lets see nothing on this side nothing on this one and so no no no charging led but these are definitely charging up so i will leave these in my gym bag just like this charging up or when i get to the gym just plug them in charge them for two minutes and you got two hours worth of battery life thats pretty dope all right um let me give zerg something to play with real quick hold up heres er check this out look go get that wow all right here we go now that i could get a better view okay super long oh im trying not to laugh too im still a little bit sick and the magnetized cable so thats one difference that the uh powerbeats three dont have they dont magnetize but now if youre buying these for the gym its a nobrainer youre gonna want to get the powerbeats 3 because these are going to stay around your ears without having to mess with any kind of wing tips without having to mess with any different size ear tips you dont have to do nothing all you have to do is put these around your ear you could do a backflip you could go synchronize swimming so you could do whatever you want these are not coming out of your ears now ill test these with or without the wings but trust me its it theyre not going to stay as good as the power beast powerbeats 3 now for the most important uh most important important test the sound right the most important ah jerks all right the most important test the sound so let me grab a phone real quick well pair these up and well see how they sound let me look for iphone all right so i was letting these charge up for a few minutes i just grabbed an iphone now lets test these out and on the side note these do have an led when theyre charging up now these feature apples w1 chip which is pretty much like nfc but a little bit better and all that means is these are going to be super easy to pair up now if you got an iphone or an ios device all youre going to have to do is power these on okay lets hit the power button and this should pop right up beats x connect now these are not just connecting to your phone theyre connecting to icloud so that means right now if i go to my macbook if i go to my imac if i go to my ipad or my ipod these headphones will automatically be connected now that only works on apple products now if you got a nonapple device samsung galaxy lg v20 whatever phone or device you got these will still work youre just gonna have to pair them up using the old school bluetooth all right so lets check these out ill do a little sound test now im not gonna do my usual sound test ill test them out with a bunch of different songs not just one song well do a bunch of different songs but im just going to slap these in right now just to get an initial impression all right so so far im using them without the wings and im using them on the stock tips the stock ticks that came with them first song all right what song we got on deck we got 50 cent all right why not take it to 50 cent all right my bad yall i was just about to test these out and i got a phone call and i dont want to blast the number on youtube so lets try these now i started the song from the beginning here we go i came in the world crying and fussing  __  we have nothing ever ghetto i knows the same trying to make a little change preacher man come around talking i dont want to hear you keep walking ima put the powder in the pot whip it till im pulling up a lot imagine when i pull it off the lot new come without a top once a morning never gonna stop  __  im on aint never gonna here we go came in the game getting money getting money  __  getting chained with the money click bang for the money change over money never see the  __  on the bottom catch it come up gotta keep it on the low wow lets go down with the 36 os look at here  __  im a okay shorty wont with me she gonna hit

my grind right now looking for me sucker then i need to be found right now look youre rolling mine right now look around right now better get in line right now i run a job right now hope you understand that  __  on the man hold on the man you know im the man  __  im the man all right all right let me chill let me chill uh yall hear these all right let me pause these lets see if theyre playing all right playing pause button does work woo all right now i got to keep it real with yall whoo all right let me calm down i got to keep it real with yall these do not sound like your classic beats headphones they sound loud crystal clear nice highs and mids but not that overpowering bass i was ready you know to get slammed with the bass nah nah ah a little bit disappointed a little bit disappointed now i gotta i gotta i gotta do a little comparison just to make sure let me let me find another iphone real quick all right here we go all right i gotta do a little comparison to make sure that its just not me being a hypebeast but um nah i dont think um i dont think these have the beats signature bass sound now if you dont care about bass then thats cool but if you dont care about bass then why buy these you know you youre basically buying beats because you want a little bit more bass lets get to the same exact song i want to make sure that that im not just being a hype beast all right so well power the beats the pal let me let me get let me grab this real quick okay now same song i got the iphone connected to power beats three alright so let me slap these in real quick yeah now i could already hear i could already hear a little bit of difference lets make sure i got max vol all right okay here we go im just waiting for that beat to drop  __  im on i aint never gonna stop yeah i wasnt wasnt wasnt blown away by these though it wasnt blown away well lets see im the man buns came in the game getting money yeah these these sound way better these sound way better click bang for the money change over money all right now what ill do is lets track these at the same time okay all right so now im gonna put one ear one in each ear yeah nah nah all right yeah all right i wasnt being a hypebeast wasnt being a hypebeast the powerbeats 3 definitely got more bass all right powerbeats 3 definitely got more bass but the beats x they are fifty dollars cheaper they sound nice and loud you get eight hours battery you get the best part though the fast fuel that five minute charge for two hours that alone might be worth it to bodies if youre not a extra base head then who cares and especially if you buy these to where at work or youre buying these to wear on the bus or the train and you dont really care about being overpowered with bass then these is cool and if youre gonna wear these running or jogging you know doing your outdoor workout you dont want them to be too loud anyway because you want to be aware of your surrounded sounds now let me pause the video real quick ill try it with these wing tips on ill try a different uh different song and well see let me try the wing tips though and see if i can get these to fall out of my ear talk amongst yourselves all right yall so we back in now i just did a few sets of my bootleg workout to see if these would stay in my ears and they did i also tested them using a bunch of different songs but my initial impression is still the same on a scale of one to ten these is cool i like the sound crystal clear nice highs and mids and they get loud but they definitely dont have that signature beats bass that you come to expect from beats headphones and im definitely not feeling that now if i had to pick between the powerbeats 3 or the beats x i would definitely go with the powerbeats 3 spend that extra 50 bucks especially if youre getting them for the gym its a nobrainer these are gonna stay in your ears way better than the beats x all right so get the powerbeats three and like i said if you buy these from amazon the black ones only you can get them for 150 bucks so itll be the same price as buying the beats x from apple now you do got some benefits to these you got eight hour battery life you do got the quick charge five minutes for two hours thats a major goal and these look and feel nice i build quality the way they look the way they feel they do stay in your ears i i tried them with the wings now personally id probably rock them without the wings but if using them in the gym you may want to you may want to use the wings all right but for me for the gym i wouldnt even take a chance id rather just use the powerbeats 3 anyway like i said on the scale of 110 these is cool now if yall know my scale you know what that means anyway hit me up in the comments let me know what yall think about these shout outs everybody that rock with me on facebook foursquare twitter google plus shout out to all the google gangsters i see yall holding down that facebook page shout out to everybody

"UCMM1y0hm7qXW8yGJ6DeQeSQ", "collection_date": "20201007 102245249190", "video_id": "5CtlRXPFl0s", "Closed Captions": " There are lots of wireless headphones These are some of your questions which I will answer in this video to help you choose intro Peace be upon you all This is your host Faisal Alsaif with an exceptional video regarding your questions about wireless headphones These headphones have become very popular and for sure you need to know what suits you the best Let me start with these questions This question is from the FreeBuds 3 headphones and if the noise cancellation works on iPhones Noise cancellation with the Free Buds 3 works on all devices as they connect with Bluetooth The feature is called Intelligent Noise Cancellation The idea behind it is that it checks the best noise cancellation settings and turn it on It is similar to adaptive noise cancellation where the mics read your surroundings then cancel their sound If there is a sound of air near you it will be cancelled once noise cancellation is turned on and the audio quality will be excellent Free Buds 3 will work with any device even with the iPhone Let us know how comfortable these headphones are Are they same comfortable as the previous AirPods generation or did the silicone affect it This question is also about the Free Buds These headphones dont come with Silicone ear tips Not having a silicone tip makes it more comfortable when you wear it You can move the headphone however you want and you wont be bothered by the silicone The silicone is sometimes irritating as you have to push it inside the ear to get the best noise cancellation AirPods Pro come with silicone tips but it is for people who want noise cancellation But with the Free Buds when you wear them you wont be isolated from your surroundings But when the Noise cancellation is turned on my voice will be higher and I wont hear my surroundings The Free Buds dont come with silicone tips but they also support noise cancellation This is the best of the two worlds It could be great for some of you You wont need silicone tips and youll still enjoy noise cancellation Which is really great But if you want noise cancellation with silicone tips then the AirPods Pro is a great choice Do the Samsung Watch and Samsung headphones work with the same phone This question was asked in the Galaxy Buds video Yes the headphones and the Samsung watch work together with the same phone With Bluetooth 4 and 5 you can connect two devices With Bluetooth 5 the connection is open But with Bluetooth 4 there were tweaks by manufacturers to enable two accessories at the same time The answer is yes Is there a sound lag in PUBG This question is very important This question was asked in the Free Buds 3 video There is no sound lag But you might notice it with other Bluetooth headphones With no latency you will be able to hear the sound as it happens All players want this feature with their headphones Thats why most gamers use wired headphones But if you dont want less latency up to our experiment there was no latency with the Free Buds The best experience is to use the headphones with Huawei devices Latency will be way reduced when connected to a Huawei device Thats what manufactures do with their accessories Does this headphone support surround sound This question was asked in the Sony headphones video This Sony headphone has caused a stir up in the wireless headphone market with all the features it is packed with Any wireless headphones with two sets is supposed to support surround sound The AirPods first gen also supported surround sound but it was not powerful But most of Sony headphones support surround sound You can also edit the sound with their app to get the best personal experience You can also choose between games movies music or audible books modes Do AirPods Pro support wireless charging And this question was asked in the AirPods Pro video Yes the Pro version supports wireless charging You can charge it with a wireless charger or a phone that supports reverse wireless charging Why no one thoroughly talks about the mic Well talk about it Dont worry I watched all the videos about the headphones and no one talked about the mics Most of the reviewers skip talking about it We make sure to review the mic performance in the videos especially with wireless headphones We cant give you a great example of testing the mics while were in a studio Some of you use their headphones while out and about with lots of noise while others use them in quiet places The experiments are different Well make sure to test the mics in the studio here to give you an example of the audio quality of the mic Does my phone have to be Huawei to use the Free Buds 3 Supposedly your phone has to be Huawei OR any other device but the ecosystem is better If you use the AirPods on Android devices you will be shocked While the AirPods with iPhone gives a very great performance Manufacturers make accessories better with their devices But they do their best so that their accessories work on other devices but the pairing wont be the same Tell us about how comfortable wearing the headphones is Is it the same as the previous AirPods or does the silicone affect it This question was from the review of the AirPods Pro When I wear the AirPods Pro I become isolated from my surroundings which is something I like sometimes But I dont like to isolated all the time as I also want to interact with my surroundings At work it is not suitable while it is great for traveling Ambient sound doesnt feel the same as natural sound though It is not only a problem with AirPods Pro it is a problem with all other headphones But it is up to the quality of the manufacturer With the Bose and Sennheiser the ambient sound is nearly natural But the AirPods Pro the ambient sound is a little bit digital Despite the fact that the AirPods Pro are very great But the ambient sound with them isnt natural Are headphones prices different from a store to another and from a country to another Free Buds costs 599 SAR but check for sales before you buy them The last question is also about the Free Buds 3 When making a phone call will the other side hear me clearly And will they also hear the background In my opinion all headphones with noise cancellation cancel the noises in the background It depends on the volume of the noises though Free Buds 3 does support noise cancellation If you are wearing it correctly the other side of the phone call will hear you very clearly Weve always received a good feedback when we tried them The experiment was great with phone calls and there was no noises in the background for the receiver But if the weather is windy it might be heard but the intelligent noise cancelation is supposed to deal with it Weve answered most of your questions Hopefully next episodes well discuss other topics We might make another video about wireless headphones Hopefully this video helps you decide whats best for you Always check the prices and services of any product before you invest in it If you want to buy one dont raise the volume to the max Dont hurt your ears Dont use them for a long time Protect your ears You cant replace them but you can replace headphones This is the end of this video Glory and praise be to Allah I witness there is no God but Allah I ask Allah for forgiveness and I repent to Him See you later", "video_title": "     ", "video_comment_count": "8710", "video_dislike_count": "5130", "video_view_count": "491564", "video_category": "28",

random Frank P theyre gonna be reviewing the Skullcandy hash three wireless headphones and school kick is a company that the audience often asked me to review products from like the crusher series a lot of their IEM stuff like that  all these were available at a hundred and thirty dollars for a nice pair of Wireless cans definitely want to check him out and that price point is kind of like an inbetween spot its not too expensive but its not cheap either so in this video well go over all the good stuff the pros and cons the case youre interested in picking these up and Ill tell you if its worth it so first off the thing that really struck me was just the house simple and plain they are and I really like that theres no crazy graphics or colors on the headphones and its so minimal for a wireless pair of headphones there is only three buttons on it on the backside of the right ear cup you have your volume up and down rocker its embedded in these rubber buttons and in the middle is like you play pause take a call etc underneath that as micro USB port for charging it you also have a 35 millimeter headphone jack on the bottom in case you want to use these wired if the battery dies then on the front side of the ear cup is also a little inline mic for you know like I said taking calls I obviously have it in black if you can get it in black like a grey a red and kind of like a navy color we do have some gloss plastic here along the yoke where the head cups sit and when talking comfort these really shine theyre ever pretty low profile but they do expand to fit larger heads fits nicely up top theyre just really really light weights with the ear cups you have definite ample padding as well as a little bit of padding on the top of the headband here definitely lightweight pair of headphones the ear cups swivel 90 degrees along the headband as well and one of my favorite things about these headphones is not only can they lay flat on a surface or something like around your neck but they also fold into the headband making these very very portable through bringing them with you on the go now hows it moving  the sound quality one thing I want to mention is we do have 40 millimeter drivers here on the Hesh 3 and like I said just tons of padding on the ear cups they do a really good job of creating like a suction and isolating and eliminating any background noise around you you should not have active noise canceling as some headphones do but they like I said they do a good job just eliminating that and creating a good but now lets talk about the sound quality thats gonna be one of the most important things when youre evaluating which headphones to buy so talking about bass these really shine in the mid loads of that area where you get a nice tight punch all around your music I listen to a bunch of things from like electronic you know some oldschool hiphop stuff like that on Spotify definitely tested a variety of songs here and really found the bass shines now as for the mids and trebles I found these kind of straight away from that flat response that and though most audio files would prefer but again these arent made for audio files themselves I felt like the mids were kind of toned back and overall I think the whole sound signature here was just tight and punchy throughout so with the vocals and stuff they werent overly like crystallized no it might sound like that nice and tinny they just did a good job of staying warm I feel and overall I think favoring the bass so if youre a bass head youre probably gonna like these so like I said audio files meant up for the sound signature that these have I for one enjoy it I thought they were kind of fun if you want to call it that to the average person who just wants a good sounding pair of headphones at that price they are not gonna mind the sound quality at all especially if you like bass now the next important thing is gonna be battery life and I believe they had these rated at 22 hours I find out throughout my week testing that pretty much held up Ill other recharge them once by listening to it constantly throughout the week know its like stuff from the the office around the office stuff like that about what really makes me happy is they had this like battery quick charge technology where if you just charge these up for five minutes you get 90 minutes of battery life so say youre new youre walking around campus or something like that youre going on a car ride these are dead well charge them for five minutes youll have an hour and a half of battery which is really good like I mentioned earlier they include the 35 millimeter headphone jack in case you want to use these wires so good yeah kind of recapping here I love the design here very simple minimal always a plus for me very lightweight and comfortable which obviously is gonna be a plus to anybody who wants to wear these out getting like a headache or anything and sound quality I thought was very good considering the price point here and they did cater to my my Christmas Hort of a signature taste that I like when listen to music for cons I do wish these included a carrying case since they are so portable I mean itd be cool just have like a little sleeve or a pouch something like that secure these around with so they dont get damaged that would have been nice and second is well the Bluetooth technology I believe is rated for like 33 feet or something like that I found that it does have a hard time going that distance when there are walls in the way so while it works for me no problems around my office when Im starting to go to different rooms or across the apartment it started to cut out a little bit but I mean for 130 here it is hard to complain theyre Wireless they look good they sound good Im a fan of them minor cons like I mentioned in the end for that price point its really not too bad you look at the competition out there for a wireless pair of headphones again not a headsets Im a fan of that I think its pretty solid price point if you want to check it out I will put it listed for you in the description down below if you like to review give it a thumbs up so your

know so anyways geeky send me a pair of bluetooth headphones so that I can pick them up oneonone against traditional headphones to see which is better in a series of different tests a series of different Tufts pickles and the first category were gonna be looking at is obtrusiveness which of these is more obtrusiveness Music Applause so in terms of obtrusiveness the traditional headphones blues now lets test the tangle factor between the two lets just take these out of my pocket shall we how does this happen I couldnt tangle them up this bad if I tried now the geek ease because they are bluetooth you can do this to them you can put them in your pocket and lo and behold they will never tangle alright so between the two which work better with an iPhone so lets test out the traditional headphones first and well see which works better how do you plug it in do I need a nap oh thats right iPhones dont have headphone jacks if an iPhone user does want to use traditional headphones they have to buy this what is that what the hell is that yeah thats what everyone wants for their iPhone a dangly ridiculous little I penis literal people sat around a conference table and were like how can we make it so you can use headphones on an iPhone oh oh I know well make some genitalia that you can strap on to it now that I actually see it attached to the iPhone I think it actually looks better in the garbage but you know what that doesnt even matter anymore anyways cuz these connect to your iPhone through bluetooth you better connect dont make me bust out the eye strap on okay here we go lets click on the geeky BAM connected so there we go I guess theres no more need for eye genitalia Music now in terms of which one gets better range I think this ones pretty obvious Music though the key keys do have a ten meter range easy win here and another advantage these have over other headphones it has a builtin mic so you can make phone calls hello yes did my cream come in yet lets see headphones do that hello hello okay well at least these headphones are good for other things now lets talk about the lifespan between the two headphones my previous pair of headphones well a couple weeks ago the left earbud became a left ear dud the left ear started too short and now its so then Ill go buy another pair of headphones and then like three months later the same thing happens all over again so yeah maybe these kinds of headphones just suck maybe I suck at picking them either way theyre a pain in my left ovary its not like I dropped with them right think its not like Im like oh I gotta listen to music now relax its okay these were broken to begin with now these are my first pair of bluetooth headphones so I can attest to the lifespan of them but I can only assume that theyre gonna last longer than three months because they wont short out like these though I do have to give bonus points to the traditional headphones cuz lets leave bluetooth headphones do this Im actually really impressed by how mature Im getting as I get older Music lets see if this works alright well I cant believe that actually kind of worked I dont know how accurate this test really is but yeah definitely the D Keys have better lowend okay so even though it is a super close race Im giving this one to the Bluetooth ease doesnt look like I have a big old booger so in terms of ease of use traditional headphones very complicated very complicated you put either ends of these into your ear gaping and you stick this end into your phone or iPod okay wheres my eye pecker and bam super complicated stuff now the Bluetooth headphones may be slightly more complicated at first and by slightly complicated I mean you have to press a button to pair your device with your device oh my god thats like so complicated and the other main difference between the two god thats so ridiculous and the other main difference between the two is the Bluetooth headphones you have to charge whereas the regular headphones you only have to replace every five minutes because they short so charging them however is a bit of a breeze because remember that cool little carrying case this is also the charger and just to come in there like this and the glowy glowing this means that theyre charging convenient and when the charger runs out of juice you just plug it in and it recharges itself super complicated stuff Music now the wireless are also waterresistant apparently theyre waterresistant for like sweat and like small droplets of water it doesnt say anywhere that theyre resistant to showers I hope I didnt break my giggys cuz I dont want to have to go back to these these are only good for one thing now but I will say this its pretty convenient when youre listening to music and you have to go to the bathroom and you can just like go you could just walk off and do your business your butt business cuz with these guys your phone is gonna have to tag along with you I gotta make a palpate all right well there you have it a one on one with the traditional versus new I dont think Im gonna be needing a pair of these anymore cuz these are just so if you want your own set of geeky headphones follow my link in the description to get them and Miley gets you 20 gotta do it get them that was very convincing and as always a huge thanks to you guys for watching I could never do what I do without you guys so I super appreciate it well get rid of this Ill see you in the next video please subscribe if you havent already and just know I love you thats it Im done peace love you okay

Dan and this video well be doing the review for the Motorola pulse escape headphones and quite a few of you who are asking me to review some budget oriented bluetooth headphones so I just saw this one and though the price quoted here on the box is six thousand four hundred ninety nine this one was available on Amazon India for two thousand one hundred and fifty rupees so I thought why not test it out so this is the headphone itself and its a bluetooth headset and as you can see in the box it claims that it has about ten hours of playback time I didnt test it completely I would say yes it lasts for a long time easily about seven to eight hours it also says it has passive noise cancellation and its light and foldable and come back to that later and apart from that here it says that it has that 40mm drivers and I mean it has a Bluetooth range of about 60 feet it says and its eally and Google compatible and the good thing is that it also has a microphone so you can actually take calls with this one so how is this this one so this is the headphone as you can see its completely made up of a plastic and yes as foldable you can fold it like this but you notice that sound plastic sound that is coming so thats the problem with this one Im scared to actually fold it because it makes that noise and dont terms of sound quality the Sun quality is surprisingly good but the build quality as it guys can guess is simply not that great so I would personally not just fold it like this and carry it in a backpack or something because Im afraid this can break this is pretty rigid and this also is not that in terms of physical overview the good thing is that it comes with these two cables also so its not mandatory to actually use it over the Bluetooth connection you can also attach it directly this in here and other end to your smartphone and this is for charging again as a microUSB cable so you can plug this to your power bank except try to charge and we also have a lid over your light and a microphone to take the calls as you can see it is blinking because its paid with my smart phone currently and this one actually hoses all the controls this is for actually powering it on or off you hold it for some times and you have Plus this is the minus and this is plus for the creasing the volume you can pause the music also if you just press it like this and also accept calls why this so all the operations are from this power game this feels very very plasticky in nature those very cheap plastic kafeel it gives Motorola should have put a lot more attention in the quality now coming to this cushion pads theyre fairly good I would say considering the price point and they good provide good cushion to your years but the fit is slightly on the tighter side so yeah youve got to get used to this one so as you can see in terms of sound now lets talk about the sound here surprisingly I was actually impressed with this one dont get me wrong its not mindboggling or whatever but considering the price point Im making a price point of about two thousand one hundred fifty to two thousand two hundred and for that price I would say the sound quality over Bluetooth I used to mostly over bluetooth currently it is still connected to my body say smartphone and it blinks and blue color when its connected when youre charging this blinks in red this actually glows red when youre charging so yeah the connection is great the Bluetooth connection is good and the sound output was actually really good in fact I would rate it about eight point five in terms of some quality so the sound quality is good but as I mentioned in terms of comfort and the feel this is very very plastic you feel it gives you that cheap plastic feel thats the problem with this one and again in terms of durability I dont think so this is going to be very durable if you are a person whos going to carry around because this doesnt give me the confidence this as you can see its making that clicking noise and stuff so again youve got to be careful if you are sort of roughy I will simply not recommend this phone but if youre a very careful user and you would probably use this one in your house and you dont have a very high budget for a Bluetooth headset you cant go with this one because the sound quality is actually good but again be prepared for that extra plasticky build quality so certainly I would say I will not recommend this for the MRP price that theyre quoting here that is 6490 but for the price of about 2100 to 2200 yes you can go with this one if you are sort of a careful user if you are a rough user I will simply not recommend you this headset because of the build quality so guys if you are using this pulse escape do share your opinion in the comment section and if you are

messages and comments from you guys asking for this video and we were playing basketball earlier today and we were like hey maybe we should do that video that was right in the middle of Matt Ross the boss putting D pain in an absolute body bag heres the proof Oh Oh God okay so back to me before we get into the video you should subscribe if you havent already youre going to love this channel if you love beats products youre going to love rizz nose also we did individual reviews of them and the link to those videos are down below in the description okay lets get to it all right so before we talk power beats three versus beat sex you should definitely check out Liz no calm thats our website we find the best deals every single day its not every single hour and we post about them on our website so stuff you actually care about we oftentimes find deals on beats headphones and jaybird headphones and Apple products and Garmin products and stuff that I think you guys really really like so I think if you arent checking out resna calm before you buy something in those categories youre probably spending too much money so check the link out right here on the screen and go to r is no com okay so why would you get the power beats three and the main reason is they are workout headphones I mean it really comes down to application when youre talking about these two headphones I mean theyre both wireless headphones theyre both Beats products and theyre both pretty awesome but the power beats three are really good workout headphones they have a very secure fit they wrap around your ear you can shake your head you can do CrossFit you can play basketball you can have a really strong strength training workout and theyre not going to fall out of your ears and theyre not going to fall off your head so a lot of people like them for that fact also they do a pretty good job of completely sealing off your ear canal so really good sound isolation both on the Thar beats 3 and on the beats X so both of them do a good job now the power beats 3 because theres a little bit more to them its going to be kind of like an ear by ear type thing so for me they dont you know isolate the sound so great but for a lot of people out there does a really good job of keeping out any of that external sound and their water in sweat resistance so if you want something with that rating you probably go power b3 they also have a cable management clip so that you know cinches them closer to your head so you can go running with them and it kind of keeps the rest of the cable out of your face with the beat X if you do go working out with them even though its got a secure fit they even come with ear fins if you shake your head around if you do anything a little bit more dynamic youre going to see that cable moving around so definitely power beats 3 anything workout youre going to want them for and they have better battery life so the power beats 3 come in at 12 hours on a single charge and the beats X are right around 8 hours so better battery life on the power beats 3 it really does come down to if youre going to use them a lot youre going to use them for working out and in terms of price point the power beats 3 are right around 200 bucks weve seen some awesome deals on that I think Ill be seeing 50 bucks off not too recently and then the beats acts are 150 dollars so there is a little bit of a price chasm there now the reason that you would get the beats X is you want all day headphones something that youre going to keep around your neck and youre going to pop them in to take a phone call or to listen to music I think theres like my buddy thats a limo driver we talked about them on our snapchat the other day or somebody thats just in the office that wants to just use headphones here and there so they are a lot more about convenience thats what the beats acts are all about they even have magnets in the tips of the earbuds so they can magnet together and you could always find the earbuds like I said they have pretty good sound isolation they got the ear fins to keep them in your ears they even have like the inline remote mic both of them have that but whats really cool with the beats X is if you put them in your ear since theyre always hanging around your neck the microphone hangs closer to your mouth so if you take a phone call the person on the other side of that phone call hears you a little bit better so thats kind of cool but still you know we are splitting hairs here theyre both beats products are both pretty awesome it really comes down to application workout headphones versus general headphones both of them have great compatibility with iOS devices they will work with Android devices but really youre going to get them if youre an iOS user if you are using iCloud if you sync them with one device you can see them all cross all of your other devices so we really like that also like I said they have the inline remote mic so youve got volume up volume down theyve got track management and Siri they work with that thats great the beats X youre going to be using a lightning cable to charge them so one cable the one thats on your iPhone and then the power beats three use micro USB both even has the quick charge feature so if you charge them for just like five minutes youre going to get an hour to two hours worth of playback which is pretty awesome I mean thats one of my favorite features about some of these newer beats procs you plug them in on your way to the gym for example and you can at least get that work at so thats awesome and because they have the w1 ship from Apple the Bluetooth range and the stability is pretty good people are not going to get in the way walls and doors I mean the stability and range is pretty good on both of these headphones and also the audio quality we havent discussed that yet so theyre pretty similar if I had to give the edge to one over the other I might give it to the beats X although theyre very close they both have good bass good mids the one thing if sometimes they sound a little bit raspy and shallow but byandlarge pretty good audio quality on both of these headphones I like them obviously if youre an audiophile youre going to say Im crazy if youre an audiophile dont get them for most people though the audio quality is just fine so really it comes down to the application like Ive said before workout headphones versus a general headphones and thats it let me know ease onto the video click the thumbs up button down below go crazy on it go beats on it if you like this video and also subscribe check out rizz no calm and Ill see you guys in the next one Music you Music Oh you", "video_title": "Beats Powerbeats3 vs BeatsX Review  Which are Best Bluetooth

even put them on the list of best workout headphones 2019 We are not entirely convinced as of yet because were in the early days of the year but we are pretty big fans Now for wireless headphones we like both the BeatsX and Power beats 3 but really the Powerbeats are the workout headphones whereas the BeatsX are mostly general headphones made to wear all day The BeatX are one of the best beats wireless earphones for keeping on you throughout the day because they feature magnets in each earbud so you can always find them Furthermore the BeatsX wireless earbuds have pretty good sound quality for the size For both we think the bass is good mids are decent and highs are good but sometimes it does sound a little shallow Anyways hope you enjoy this BeatsX vs Powerbeat3 review\n\nBeats

"ejBLljBG5Ek", "Closed Captions": " whats up guys Im random Frank P today were gonna be reviewing the razor thresher ultimate headset now a quick note before you begin the thresher ultimate comes in an xbox version and one for the ps4 both do work on PC and I obviously have the Xbox one version that Ill be reviewing for you guys you could pretty much take everything Im saying here and apply it for that ps4 variant because its the same thing now a quick look inside the box to see whats inside and we as always have some nice packaging from Razer always gotta give them props for the unboxing experience inside youll find the headset the audio hub which is going to be like the base for all your connectivity and your wireless pairing we have an optical cable if you choose to use that plus two micro USB cables one for charging and one for connecting it underneath that also inside the box they include a stand for the thresher which is always pretty cool I could definitely appreciate something like this being included with the headset because not only does it give it a nice place for it to stay when youre not using it it keeps everything organized so its not just laying down somewhere possibly getting damaged the first thing were gonna do is go over the layout and the buttons on the thresher ultimate and on the bottom of the ear cups is where pretty much everything is on the left side theres a little volume wheel for your microphone and on the right side is the volume wheel just for the headsets overall volume both of the wheels can be pushed into either mute the headset or mute the microphone then the left ear cup is also the microUSB port for charging it and the power button which to turn on and off or to pair to the hub you have to hold in for 3 seconds next is the retractable boom mic here on the bottom on the left ear cup when you put it on its nicely stowed away if you want to use it and pull it out it can get bent right in front of your mouth for you which is always really great and I like what headsets do this because its not just theyre you know dangling when its not in use if you just put it back into the ear cup so it wont get like bent or anything like that dont worry Ill have a mic test for you in just a few minutes and now for the overall design of the thresher ultimate I really like it it doesnt look too aggressive but at the same time it lets you know its a razer headset we do have 50 millimeter drivers here and extremely soft leather earpads that its like pillows on your ear very very comfy on the side of the drivers its kind of like an open grilled at the same time its still considered closed back and the way that the headband is constructed is really great because it allows a headset to sit on your head while applying zero pressure you can see it can push up the band itself he had these two aluminum bands on top just for really a structure support but the band with the mesh and the the padding inside is really really nicely it just sits on your head zero pressure and adjusts by itself big fan of the comfort and another feature that I always appreciate is the ear cuffs themselves also to stay flat 45 degrees you can rotate them down so you like putting around your neck or something if you want to lay them flat on your desk you can then were gonna talk about the audio bass real quick its nice and compact which is always good you have your Razer logo on top on the front of the bass is the power button youll notice a little green strip light up on the bottom to let you know when its powered on and on the back is gonna be all your connections you have your optical in and optical out cables if you choose to use that even though its included it with Xbox and a PC switcher your micro USB port for connecting it to your PC or your Xbox one and the USB port there for charging it if you need to if you want to use it on your Xbox the only difference you have to make is putting that switcher on the back side to the Xbox side or switch it to the right size and want to use it for your PC really that easy whats also really cool is with the included headphone stand and this audio base they kind of fit together the headphone stand just goes right on top of it itll snap into place and now you can have the base your headphone stand and your headphones sitting all as one unit when youre not using it I can definitely appreciate that design choice here from Razer keeping down on clutter is always good so next is the most important part about this headset and that is the audio quality and overall for most I refuse I dont give ratings or anything but I feel like before headsets or headphones thats where its most appropriate but I could say the Thresher ultimate here for being a wireless headset Im gonna give the audio quality itself a 9 out of 10 when its just on the regular audio setting I found that a lot of times pretty much on Xbox I used it for games like you know FIFA and Madden so it wasnt really putting it to its fullest test you know but on PC I used it a lot for games like Battlefield or battleground where no positional audio is everything thats very important and I found just overall everything sound very crystal clear but you will kind of expect that for that 250 price point but I do want to mention one thing which I think is pretty severe on top of the audio base you have a little button which can enable there like Dolby surround sound and this is kind of a pretty big selling point you know a wireless headset with Dolby Surround but Im telling you guys right now do not use that because it completely kills the audio experience what it pretty much does is just boosts the mids a little bit but everything else kind of gets like drowned out when I was playing battlegrounds the plane was flying over me with it disabled that I could directly hear where it was coming from what direction and once I had it V dole weve turned on everything to sound like it was in both ear cups so you do lose that directional stereo audio when it is turned on like I said I cannot recommend that that advice pretty much bought you a chicken dinner and now for the next part is gonna be the mic test which is probably the second most important thing here it is automatically you know enabled once you have your PC or your xbox power it on you can use it for you know chatting with your friends online on your xbox party so Ill do a mic test for you guys on both platforms you could hear how it sounds alright so real quick this is the mic test for you guys hooked up to the PC so this is how it would sound if you were streaming on Twitch or something or youre talking to your friends unedited audio and just real quick for the next portion Ill just talk about the battery life so you can hear how this sounds it does say 16 hours on the box or you know thats what its rated at I found it got a little bit closer to 14 hours battery life probably because Im switching back and forth between my xbox one a my PC so whether they give you guys that little tidbit of information so you can hear how the mic sounds so now to switch it up a bit to give you guys a mic test like if you were playing xbox one in games stay in party chat this is how it would sound again with the game in the background to kind of differentiate here and see how the sounds versus the PC if there is a difference but again its how its gonna sound if you are in an Xbox one party with a game going in the background you can get an idea of how its gonna sound now honestly I would a lot better everything just sounds hollowed out and kind of tinny and far away and for 250 I wanted some better mic quality out of this especially with things out there like the antlion mod mic and the mass drop mini mic sounds ten times better for like fifty dollars and under since this is an allinone you know its Wireless its built into the headset I guess theyre taking the kind of a cut back there with the mic quality its gonna be okay if youre just you know playing with your friends online you wouldnt be doing like Pro voiceovers for YouTube or anything but thats just my two cents now for the overall wrap up here of the razor thresher Ultimates like I said I dont really do ratings and stuff but I feel like all around its a solid eight its very very comfortable it is definitely one of the most comfortable headsets that Ive tried for this size I mean its not like discreet or anything its overall kind of big but its nice and light for the most parks everything thats going on here and with the headband and the ear cups it is just very very comfortable the sound quality stock without the Dolby Surround enabled is fantastic absolutely great audio pretty much zero distortion or buzzing in the background since it is Wireless usually have some interference but there was nothing really audible with this the biggest downfall is gonna be having that Dolby Dolby Surround enabled and the mic overall and I guess that price points gonna be a little bit of a con for most people because thats very expensive but if you need a wireless headset for both the Xbox one and your ps4 or your PC like how you can buy either variant whatever console you have this is a pretty good option you do get the included headphone stand and that nice audio base but you connect together for one unit which is really great and all together I think an 8 is a pretty solid pretty solid number or good rating for these so if you guys want to check it out or find out more about these if you want to pick them up I will put a link to the Razer thrush your ultimate headset in the description down below like I said it for both Xbox one and ps4 if you guys liked this review definitely give it a big thumbs up and

"U1jK8D2I4mY", "Closed Captions": " welcome to the best where we find the best product in its category on this episode were looking for the best noise canceling wireless headphones Im Ayas act heart with our expert David Carr noise were going to judge these headphones on five different criteria lets start by introducing the competitors the Jabra elite 85h both noise cancelling headphones 700 bang amp olufsen vo play h9 sony WH 1000 X mark 3 and sennheiser momentum 3 Wireless now David why are these the ones were choosing from because they would be the ones that I would be choosing from these are all premium models they all cost 300 or more its obviously pretty expensive there are several others that cost a little bit less but these really are the best of the best right now anyway all right first matter is noise canceling lets explain how noise canceling headphones work now these headphones have microphones on them to hear sounds around them that sound is analysed and then the headphones produced their own noise to cancel out the external noise okay David how did our competitors fare these are all really good at noise canceling some are slightly better we gave this round to the Bose partially because not only does it do the noise cancelling of sound around you while youre listening to your music but when youre making calls the noise reduction on this is really great you can make calls on these in noisy environments not all of these can do that when it comes to different environments like a droning airplane or lets say the intermittent noise of a city did any one of these fare better in a different environment the Bose might be slightly more tuned to airplane noise but right now these are all some of them have they adjust on the fly to the environment youre in the Sony does that I personally dont like it that much because sometimes you hear a little thing that goes off in the headphones when it makes a switch to performer no chance really so I tend to go with a fixed level of noise cancelling whenever I can in terms of the pecking order of these again there are slight differences I would say the Sony and the Bose are at the top and then you have the other ones just a touch down with some small variations in terms of it always cancel the winner of this round is the Bose because of its noise reduction for making calls thats top notch but you might be wondering why are we listening to this guy anyway what does this guy know about headphones heres why David Carr knowing executive editor hes been with CNET for almost 20 years he reviews headphones earbuds portable audio products he readers mobile accessories and more David was a key figure in founding CNETs consumer electronics review program in 2000 they even call him Wireless Dave outside of Tech David has written three mystery novels you obviously know what youre talking about lets keep digging into your brain round two features headphones do a lot more than just making sound lets start with something like controls but they each have controls on them three of these have touch controls the sony the bose as well as the Bang amp Olufsen some people like that some people dont the Sennheiser and the Jabra have physical buttons people like those physical buttons better on the Sony for instance there was one small complaint that people had about it in really cold temperatures they were complaining that the controls actually didnt work now the new bose we asked them about that they claimed that those touch controls will work in cold temperatures I think everyones now aware of that but the electronics do freeze up in really cold temperatures do we have any unique features about any of these things because I mean they cant just be all the same right a lot of them have adjustable levels of noise canceling the Sennheiser has a new feature it has a tile a little piece of tile technology so that you can track it on your phone so if its house a little Bluetooth tracker so if you lose the device anywhere other tile devices essentially create a network so you can find this if you leave it on the subway if you leave it on a train if you leave it in your house somewhere and so obviously these are expensive headphones could get stolen all these have a transparency mode that allows ambient sound in so theres noise canceling but then theres that you want the reverse sometimes you want to be able to hear the outside world the Bose has very natural transference mode at almost when you put that on it almost feels like youre its as if you took them off yeah its as if you took them off Wow its sony has some very interesting features in terms of it has a quick attention feature where you put your hand over the ear cup say youre on a plane talking to a flight attendant so you can put it on to know youre watching the movie you you want to talk for a second it mutes your sound and then you can talk to him or her and then you let it go and youre back to listening to your movie these devices do they all use microUSB are they using wireless charging how do you charge these guys these all use USB see which nice which they all should and that also theres also a quick charge feature in these so you can charge them for 15 minutes and in a lot of cases get a couple hours of battery life all of these get over 15 hours of battery life some of them do more the sony has up the most hours that their its rated at 30 hours had moderate volume levels I mean USBC is really useful because if your phone really uses it you dont need to have a special charger for these guys thats great when it comes the battery life thats gonna vary depending on how you use these things if your listen to music movie loudly were listening to certain kinds of music things will change by person and by music and as David mentioned all of these guys survive over 15 hours so if youre worrying about battery life over time that might change but 15 hours when theyre brand new at least and then youve quick charges on top of it yeah and one feature actually some people want is if the battery dies will it still play music and somebodys certainly do that including the new new Bose the other thing worth mentioning is these all could be wired headphones and most of them work as a wired headphone if the battery dies so you dont necessarily need power to listen to them one of the other kind of convenience features with these is that some of them turn on automatically for instance when you these fold up the Sennheiser you can hear it saying uh noise what does it say it said power off power off okay okay and then when you go like that power on and the the job is also do that when they they fold flat and then when you put them on they automatically go on alright so which one takes the cake when it comes to features we are giving it to the Bose lionos oh its fine knows it does again it it has adjustable levels of noise cancelling it also is the only one that has always on Alexa if you want it that means that you can program it you can choose between Google assistant and Alexa and you can either use a button if you want or with Alexa anyway not Google assistant you can say the way qward Alexa and and talk to it in it will respond so it right now is the only headphone of these on top of that the Bose does have a little extra feature called Bose ar ar is an augmented reality is the audio of materiality its a new platform does that even mean like would it cant show you images its gonna automatically so the idea is like if you would be out there in a foreign city for instance there would be an app that would tell you what youre looking at there sensors that you can actually look at a building and it would tell you exactly what youd be looking at but like a guided tour is through the EM theres other applications with that but thats what Bose is thats one of the easy things to understand and again that that the ability the noise reduction capabilities while youre making calls and it being the best for making calls we think the job is probably a close second the Sony isnt quite as good as from making calls the Sennheisers quite good the banging off since decent but really its the the bose and john per second the Jabra Jabra makes obviously is known for its headset so it this is a very good headphone also for making calls is theres a feature called side tone that allows you to hear your voice in the headphones as youre talking so youre not the person yelling when you have the headphones on is that what youre telling me wow I need lots of people to get those then so the the new Bose has that job or has that the Sennheiser has it as well so that thats a nice feature to have theres a lot of great features everywhere but this round goes to Bose because its packed with lots of useful features it stays in the lead lets move on to round 3 which is Comfort whats good are headphones if they hurts to wear we asked a few people around the office to find out theyre for impressions of these headphones alright shopper what you got well it feels comfortable it feels pretty good nobody this super comfortable actually Ive used Sony a different model of Sony that are shaped similar to this yeah this is pretty comfortable also very comfy it feels good lightweight I dont like the fit of this one I usually dont like round ear cuffs because they dont fit my ears right definitely comfortable in the ears those headphones they are comfortable oh this is nice this is also less bulky this is I guess Anheuser yeah alright too heavy okay you just feel a little heavier I did choose one huh girls Im down with the silver I think Sonys gonna be my pick if I was to actually purchase headphones today these would be it the Sony because its lighter and the cushion is the softest I think this one is the most comfortable and also one of them must be ready for once lots of different opinions with Sony getting the most votes but you know those people had a very limited time when it came to these headphones David how long do you wear them to find out how comfortable they are I mean I certainly wear them for hours at a time will be a wear one for a full day mi try Mon as you mentioned this and I even go on for a week or two swapping between them I personally dont have a problem with the comfort of any of these theyre all very comfortable headphones but there are slight differences that might work better for one person another these Sennheisers I feel like Im wearing those things you see from construction workers but they are built really well and they have that iconic momentum designed a lot of people like these are brand new to the market and we pick up the Sonys if I have they have they feel like these these feel light until recently what happened was you had a fight between the Sonys and the old bows which were the QuietComfort 35 twos which have been on the market for a while a lot of people still like that model we didnt include in this roundup but it certainly is one of the best noise cancelling headphones in terms of comfort people think that in some ways is a little bit more comfortable than the new new ones so thats why were leaning towards the Sonia is the most comfortable it is the lightest the the bose actually got slightly heavier than the QuietComfort 35  it does have that metal band and it clamps down slightly more than the old model and some people dont like it as firmly on their heads again I didnt have a problem with it but some people do the Comfort round goes to Sony now what about sound quality if youre wearing headphones you want to hear your favorite music as clearly as possible now David had to test out sound quality or listening to lossless files streaming what in a lot of case were doing more realworld where were doing Spotify at the highest level possible title we also have about 20 tracks we listen to a lot of a be testing but were pulling one headphone off and also some jury testing so we have a few people listen these is just not just me because I hear things a certain way Ive certain tastes in music so then we come to some conclusions about the sound regarding that so the issue with it these all sound really good I dont think anybodys gonna be disappointed with the sound quality of any of these there are slight differences and slight first since the the sony is gonna got a more energy in the bass when you say energy in the bass what does that mean its just got its its got more um its its a welldefined bass but its got a little bit more kick to it and for someone who listens to maybe hip hop and and you know EDM dance I always listen to you know that type of stuff its is its gonna its gonna feel more visceral weirdly bose is not associated necessarily with an audio file type sound profile but this its a very wellbalanced headphone very clean sound and clear doesnt have as much energy in the bass so its its better to find bass than in the previous model to climb comfort 35  not everybody is gonna like that as much this the sony is a little warmer headphone same goes for I would say the Sennheisers you know another great sounding headphone a little bit more on the bass in terms of oomph to the bass and then you know you have the Bang amp Olufsen it has a little bit more detail in the detail you hear more travel youre in the higher note yeah so you know it might be say youre listening more jazz and classical music okay I want to hear it you want to hear the separation between the instruments very clear separation something like the baingan Olsen or the Bose is probably to give you a little bit better experience these are all wireless headphones theres a compromise with Wireless compared to compromise with both wireless and boys cancelling so youre degrading the sound buddy a little bit with with each so because youre adding the noise from the noise canceling on top of the audio you want to listen to in the first place so youre not exactly getting the pure audio you would have gotten if you were like sitting at home in a quiet room with headphones on alright so which one of these has the best sound quality I Im gonna give it to the Sony because Sony coming back its got a nice warm sound its kind of forgiving in terms of you gonna listen to a lot of genres of music good detail again a little bit more kick to the bass that said all these are a close second alright Sony gets the win for this round now lets not forget these headphones are really great all the sound is very good its very close but were here to find the best of the best lets see who walks away the winner time for round five and thats value David what does value mean to you I mean I think it just is bang for the buck and when it comes to these these some of these models are very expensive today Nielsen is 500 thats 500 bucks it is the third generation of the headphone some of the earlier models there was a there was a previous h9 and there was an h9 i those wells actually sell for less soon if you if you really had your eye on this one you could probably wait it would come to a little bit in price the Sennheiser is 400 and the bose is 400 the Sony is at 350 but its been around a while so its really come down to 300 and sometimes youll even see it for a little bit less as were standing here today the Jabra is on sale for 250 its usually 300 but I also expect that to come down in price but in terms of bang for the buck if because these are 100 less than the Bose were saying these have a little bit more bang for the buck right now these are the Sonys were talking theres a Sony WH a 1000 X and Mark 3 that rolls off the tongue it is a great headphone after five rounds the best noise canceling wireless headphone overall is the Sony WH 1000 X Mark three David lets recap what makes the Sonys the best of the best obviously a great sounding headphone of the most comfortable nice feature set it also delivers the most bang for the buck at this point thank you to David everyone who tried on the headphones and you great viewers let us know what you think of the results your voice is important and

fantastic things here on Amazon and across the internet a lot of people ask me beau what are your favorite headphones because you review quite a few online and I am here today my loyal materialistic minions to tell you that these are my favorite headphones specifically for sporting type activities this is what they look like via theyre called the end pouch ETAs and this is why I like them first of all theyre bluetooth so Wireless theres no wire dangling down here to get in your way secondly its just how they fit in your ears I dont know about you but when youre running the little dangling ones or other type of headphones that smash straight on youre always having to adjust them these they poke right in there and for extra security there is a little something that goes over your ears and they gently grip gently grip the back of your head so they really really really stay in place you will forget about these once you put them on very very cool and if youre wondering they fold up very nicely and you can stick them in your gym bag or your backpack and just move on if you ever confused how to put these on just make a mental note r is for right L is for left obviously I hope you know that and just hold them like this and once you visualize it in front of you take it and put it right on like that my wife was actually having issues with trying to untangle it and put it on just unravel it and put it straight on very easy very simple they do come with extra little ear plugs in case your ear canals are abnormally large Id say that these would fit ninety percent of people out there on just the stock ones that come on here theyre very easy to to turn on which I which I really really like about these things so up top right here you can barely see the little black button so all of the buttons are on the right hand side I got a lot of headphones we buttons are on both sides and youre trying to adjust the volume and you end up turning them off and all the buttons are on the right side which is cool the top button is the onoff button if you hold it down for five to ten seconds that will go into bluetooth pairing mode and it will connect to your iPhone or MacBook Pro and then underneath is the the forward and back button I believe no Im sorry the volume up and down there is no forward and back button on these huh very minimalist volume up and down and then also they have the small little tiny USB port and thats how you charge them using the included USB cable as for talking on the phone with these things its possible a lowend ENCOM my name is Bohus Ewa soo I review also its a fantastic thing on Amazon and across the internet if youre wondering why I found so funny well thats because I am actually recording audio from the mpow cheetah headphones and right now I am actually talking directly into the iPhone not into any sort of Bluetooth speaker headphone anything of that nature my mouth is about three inches away from my iPhone not using any sort of Bluetooth headset whatsoever if you really want to talk on the phone with with incredible clarity get a microphone thats right next to your your your mouth you can take a few calls with this but I would not suggest using this if youre going to rely off of this on a call center or if youre using this for business trips or anything youre going to sound very unprofessional and very poor thats just the nature of all of these headphones with a microphone all the way back here because its this far away from your mouth and youre projecting out in this direction and so its really hard for this to pick up just your voice because its also picking up everything behind you its just the nature of these headphones that have mics right on the ear so with that being said its a five out of five star type product they look cool they sound incredible they stay in place and theyre extremely comfortable battery life lasts me more than several workouts worth and so thats what Im looking for and nice people at mpow as well they actually sent me this sample in exchange for honest tests and thorough demonstration in review and it passes my honest review with flying colors five out of five stars if youre wanting to work out with music pick these things up you will not regret it my name is beau chef su and I hope youve enjoyed this fantastic review huge", "video_title": " Mpow bluetooth

fear and today Ive got some very very exciting news that for some reason Nintendo themselves didnt want to harp on about yes with the latest 40 firmware on the switch you can now use wireless headphones sort of unfortunately you can tap into the switches Bluetooth because its keeping all those channels free Im guessing for controllers and stuff rather its actually USB audio that the switch now supports which is a weird thing because not many things really use it overall but some of them do and some of them are wireless including for some reason the PlayStation one I say for some reason its pretty standard its just weird that it works on the switch now the installation is a little bit complicated but if you follow my steps you should be absolutely fine all you need to do is take this USB dongle and plug it in Music then turned the headset on I suppose yes honestly its just that easy it just supports the out of the box which is really really weird but it works brilliantly and as soon as you plug it in youll get this little notification in the top lefthand corner which is actually up there isnt it and itll just say USB and then theres a little icon of a speaker suggesting USB audio and it is as simple as that youll get audio coming through on here its fan dabby dozy now if youre a little bit skeptical you think weve made something up or you think that this is just not really actually gonna happen then do please take some solace in the fact that we have a track record of not giving out any kind of false information knowingly also were going to prove it because surprisingly this also works in handheld mode however you are going to need something else youre gonna need one of these or something very similar a USB to USB C adapter now this is just actually a little portable dock dongle thing that Ive got but it works dividends it doesnt mean powering lovely so to prove this Im gonna take the headphones stick them around my neck like this so that theyre over the microphones are hopefully you should be able to hear things hopefully that wont muddy my voice too much but it probably will a bit were gonna take the switch were gonna turn it on were going to play some splatoon too apparently and there we go this is definitely splatoon  Im running around and jumping oh I didnt mean to do that sorry I didnt mean to  exactly Im apologizing to the inkling anyway were gonna have to do this in one take to prove theres no trickery going on plug this in here the headphones are already on and this goes in like this so as you can hear the audio still coming from the switch stick that in you see that says USB at the top and come on come on did I turn it off I think I turned it off hang on wheres the switch ah there we go now wait wait wait and its coming through the headphones like look makes no difference to the audio level thats all I can take this all the way over here its still connected its going through wireless headphones the switch is got me through wireless headphones and then if we want to we can just disconnect that an immediate that comes through home this as well its it just works straight out of the box exactly as you would want it to and honestly its marvelous now obviously its quite cumbersome to have this hanging a lobotomy you switch but its just nice to know that it at least works and who knows maybe a Nintendo on the hush about it because theyve got their own headset very similar to this maybe that theyve got coming out in the future maybe itll work with us PC as well thatd be lovely unfortunately we cant attest to any of the other wireless USB dongle based headsets that are out there because this is the only one weve tested its the only one we can test unfortunately but if youve got one yourself that you want to test let us know how you get on down there in the comments just make sure youre on the latest firmware thank you so much for watching if you like this video then wanted you plug that subscribe button into your switch and see what happens and page of check out in 10 comm for all sorts of lovely Nintendo related content thank you again for watching bye bye Music", "video_title": "Wireless Headphones

yourselves alright so I just tested these out and honestly day I D Y day I alright em eh these is man day I basically they sound like some twenty dollar headphones they sound like the headphones that come with your phone just wireless all right so lets rate these real quick how do they fit not the most comfortable in the world the wings is pretty much trashed how do they look see for yourself man nothing fancy and how do they sound basically they sound like the headphones that come with your phone nothing special at all alright so if you serious about your workout game I would definitely pass on these these are make a nice little Christmas grab bag gift or if you just want some headphones to throw around or headphones to wear to the beach you dont care if they get broke or they get lost and they pick these up other than that I would pass on these all right so have to m house next up we got the m power sport bluetooth headphones now hes going to run you 25 bucks now hes pretty much looked similar to the powerbeats threes if I see lets check these out I shoes about to dip with the headphones all right here we go okay so lets see what these are now a matter of fact before I found

same how do they look they look like a set of power beats die to set a knock off power beats and how do they sound they sound ok they definitely a little bit louder than your stock headphones they got a lot of bass but the bass is kind of muddy I just not that clean rich bass thats definitely money back youre not gonna want to rock these at max volume on a bass heavy song its gonna sound like trash so basically 22 bucks again another set of throwaway headphones makes a nice little gift give them to the kids I would say the best thing about these is this little cable right here you see it has

havent heard anything that blew me away yet lets keep it moving now in a side note Im not gonna test the call quality for all these headphones because these are basically sports headphones thats made for you in the gym or main phone when youre working out doing some activities you up in the gym get you ass off the phone and workout alright stop going to the gym and talking on the phone who cares

like them but not for the gym and definitely not 420 bucks check this out heres the one plus bullets Wireless they look exactly the same that feel the same and they sound the same but the bullets are half the price and with the bullets you actually have wings so theyre gonna stay in there is a little bit better than the beats X all right so lets rate them how do they fit they do fit nice and comfortably but if youre doing income benchpress or youre doing some activities were sweating a lot no wings theyre gonna pop out of your ears how do they look they do look nice all right simple and straightforward but the best part about these is the sound they sound great nice and loud heavy on the bass all right so I do like them but again for 120 bucks no and definitely not for the gym all

headphones shoutout to jbird we got another win on deck ok how do they fit perfectly oh youre gonna love these wings no matter what sport or activity you doing they not gonna move around theyre not gonna fall out of your is now you can use the comply foam tips if you want but I didnt even need them but these are dope how do they look sleek and stylish pretty good how did they sound that easting sound incredible just like the tower pros you got that same jbird app playing with all the EQ settings if you go to headphones you got 5 my buds just get you lose them itll let you know the last place you had them but again the key to these jaybird headphones its all about the app use that EQ customize it to the way you like it these headphones gonna sound incredible now do I like them better than the V motor so far right now lets say the V motors are still the best these are definitely in the top five all right lets keep it moving alright next up we got the Bravin fly sport power now hes gonna run you 150 bucks sweat proof 20 hours play time Bluetooth and wireless lets see 20 of our play time with the power band I said thats gonna double as extra power you got adjustable ear hooks Pierce wirelessly ip67 dust and waterproof high Glo lasers you got laser beams ambient over the awareness smart app control quickrelease cable all right so this little neck band thats actually extra battery power alright 150 bucks lets check these ones out okay now why do I keep tripping the bikes from the back I just maybe maybe its an easier way it is what it is all right quick start god we just gonna have to unbox it and reverse lets see what you get in this little box first okay so heres your microUSB charging cable this is your carrying pouch okay you got some different earbuds lets see and here we go now this is gonna be this is your neck band with extra power now you dont have to rock this if you dont want to but what play wouldnt see how it feels and these are gonna be your headphones okay can I do this without breaking them alright it is okay now these look similar to the last bravins what the wings are automatically built into it let me see can you disconnect them nope okay lets see how this works now this is gonna be this little you see the little cradle right here little pins go into this cradle I guess if youre doing some longdistance running in a long range training you might want to rock this for extra battery this looks kind of small I dont even think I could get this around my neck but try it out alright so I just tried out the Bravin fly sport powers and I got to keep a railroad job on a scale of one to ten these are a triple major go these are my new favorite headphones I shout out the brave in they did it again with three four three these headphones are incredible first things first the fit the fit is 100 perfect now I was a little bit concerned because this piece right is a little bit small I got a big neck giggity so I wasnt sure if it was gonna be too tight but it fits nice and snug and it keeps the headphones from moving around you also got the wings so once you get the wings locked in they not going to move now check this out let me power them on again this little battery piece is dope too because not just a neck guard its actually a battery all right so lets turn the power on watch this youre gonna like this remember I said ladies of beams these are the laser beams right here now if youre riding your bike in the middle of the night youre definitely going to be seen now check this out when you go to the app and let me open up the brave an app real quick lets go to the app let me connect these to the headphones now watch this I see you pair your audio we hit done got audio controls so you can change all the EQ settings you got ambient awareness so if youre outside walking around and you dont want to get hit by a car turn that on you turn on bass boost well talk about the sound in a minute but the bass boost is intense but check this out go to light controls you can actually change the laser beams you see that so this would be a couple of flashes in a long pause if you want you could just have it steady flashing or you could just leave it on so when Im doing my bike light activities in the middle of the night Im just gonna leave these on you got all that extra batteries so you dont have to worry about draining the battery how do they look they actually look nice all right so you see that piece is wrapped around the neck nice snug secure fit I like it but the best thing about these headphones is the sound so far these are the loudest ones and they have the most bass and when you add that bass boost this is gonna blow you away all right so one hundred and fifty bucks for these yeah this is a major major major go so far right now these are my new favorite gym headphones in the wireless department lets keep it moving we got two more next up we got the SOL run free Pro BIOS and hes gonna run you 150 bucks 11 hours battery life AI technology with realtime voice coaching now if you have you into running youre gonna like that voice coach in me personally the only time I run is when Im running for the ice cream truck so I aint gonna need that feature lets see what else you got supreme sound quality realtime voice coaching 11 hours battery life you got a reflective cable led safety light you got to be flex biomech engine for collecting biomechanics data what does that mean I dont know waterproof and weatherproof organ ama design for comfort and secure fit alright so 150 bucks lets check these out okay now what else got head angles symmetries step with shot vertical auscultation alright so if you into running you want to check these out now in the interest of time Im not gonna make this into a full review if yall curious about that stuff hit me up and well check it out later right now were just going for sound quality look and feel I so here we go sole run run free BIOS I got a bunch of soul headphones same carrying case I lets see struggle in again inside heres your different wings now these are different wings I want to show you how to ease look in a second theres your ear tips microUSB charging cable okay good we got some wings already installed I like the sole wings better than all of the other wings and let me show you why okay what else it anything else and usual books and  __  poison for the trolls file or lap all right I hate these little stickers now for the headphones thats one thing about these soil headphones that I notice they dont use the regular wings they use these kind of wings like look like this lets see if I can slap it on real quick not knocking the camera over lets see now Im gonna have to take this piece off alright basically the wind goes like this matter of fact let me set them up Ill do a little test and then well talk more about them alright so I just used the sole run free BIOS and on a scale of 1 to 10 Im giving these a double major go I like them but theyre not my favorites alright so lets break it down first things first the fit now they do fit nice and snug on you is very comfortable theyre not going to move around and theyre not gonna fall out so if you run in youre good to go now me personally I like to wrap around wings a little bit better for when Im doing the incline bench but these is good to go next the look they do look nice minimalistic style lets turn them on real quick I want yall to see the lights I so want your power these up if you notice they do light up and you got reflective cables I so Im definitely liking the look and you got the cable management clip real nice now for the sound the sound ones is pretty good not the best unlike the V motors better I like the bravins better but the sound is nice and loud a lot of bass but if you buy knees for running and you like that artificial intelligence with the voice coach the voice coach is crystal clear and super loud the voice is real natural it sounds like somebodys talking to you so again Im not a runner but if you into running these might be the best for that our voice commands lets keep it moving all right so we got one more we got the bose sound sport now hes gonna run you 150 bucks lets go through the features dynamic wireless sound stable comfortable ear tips small medium and large sweat and weather resistance enhance headphones with the bose connect app inline microphone and up to six hours per charge now if yall watch my truly wireless video the Bose was my favorites so Im hoping these might be the same here we go lets check these out now if you ever bought anything from Bose you already know what to expect quality take a nice little presentation right here I like that the tricep I should be getting it in alright here we go Bose sound sports now whenever you buy Bose headphones for some reason it was kind of big I remember two wireless ones the truly wild ones that was kind of big and I had the same reaction like this is kind of big but they blew me away so lets see if these are gonna do the same lets see what else you get okay you get a little carrying case with a carabiner hook lets see you got some more wings more ear tips well actually these are two sets of wings I see got large and small a little poison for the trolls and theres your microUSB charging cable any usual books alright so lets try these out matter of fact let me see maybe I show you the headphones first after all this is a review alright lets see you got NSC nice clicky buttons little people management clip with the Bose Lant logo on it I will peel these stickers off in a minute just a little bit on the big side lets hope we got big sound alright so lets try these out alright so I just used the bose sound sports and i got to be honest with job on a scale of one to ten here we go again these are a triple major go these are easily the best sounding ones yet let me break it down first things first the fit now was a little bit concerned because these are kind of big so i thought they was gonna fall out of my ears they do not fall out of here is now i really tested these i went on my income bench I tried to go upside down Im trying to shake my head trying to get them to fall out they would not fall out I sort of fit its perfect next the look now the look is a little bit on the big side as you can see for yourself but again Ill sacrifice those big earphones for big sound and speaking of the sound the sound door needs the bass is so clean and rich now the V motors might have a little bit more of a heavier sounding bass but if I had to pick one for overall sound the best overall sound Im going with the Bose alright so we  four  shout out to Bose they got me again these are gonna be my new favorites let me show you something else real quick now you got the Bose app if you want to you can hit your headphones so say you and your girl ladies you and your man and Buffy I got a set of Bose headphones you can share the music right from the app to that bar  both headphones thats pretty dope and also you got your battery life you got your music and you got all your settings Bose has done it again alright so this what Im gonna do Im gonna pause the video Im gonna set everything up and well rate them from 1 to 10 Im pretty sure the Bulls gonna be my number ones I just want to test the V Motors and I want to test the bravins one more time you know all through you side by side and I get back to yall with the top ten all right so lets wrap this up and count off my top ten number ten on the list we got the brave in fly sports number nine we got the beats X number eight we got the jaybird tower pros number seven Sol run free BIOS and number six the power beats three Wireless now up until today these was my favorites they didnt even make it to the top five number five we got the Bravin fly sport reflex with the builtin power bank number four we got the jbird xforce number three v motor base fits now these probably got the most based on all of them on the table with the wings these are major go number two the Bravin powers now any day of the week these could probably be my favorites I love the little laser beam lights you got the extra battery on the back the fitment is perfect these are beasts for the gym and number one the bose sound sports I both did it again these have the

favorite the best cheap true wireless earbuds lets jump to it okay so Im sure youre well aware the fact that there are a million different cheap true wireless earbuds out there weve tested a bunch of them obviously we havent tested them all so if you found some that are awesome that you really like make sure to write us down below in the comments you know we have this huge platform 400000 people so you can help out all the other people that are watching todays video by writing the comments and letting them know yeah I found some that are awesome that belong on the list but I will tell you you dont have to go outside on my list these are gonna be your favorite I think that one of the four youre really really going to like and most of them are priced about the same as the famous ShamWow hi its Vince with ShamWow youll be saying WOW every time you use this towel anyways what are you looking for with cheap true wireless earbuds theres basically three things number one price right all of these are under 50 I think 50 bucks is the threshold for being considered cheap the second thing is they have to cover the basics right a decent Bluetooth range decent audio quality decent setup process they have to have you know all of the basics covered if you can expect them from really highend headphones do they have somewhat of what you get from the 200 version or the 150 version so do they have the basics covered now the third thing is are they from a somewhat wellknown brand I dont want to recommend brands that are gonna be gone tomorrow so these are from relatively wellknown brands at least on Amazon and if we did find some that werent from reputable brands we tried to find alternatives for you guys so I think that stuff makes sense to everybody and most people will agree on that and with that out of the way lets get to the first ones on the list Im going with the J lab J butts air so these are my under fifty pick and the reason I like these and by the way we did do a full review of them so Ill link that in the description but the reason I like them is because theyre from a very well known brand theyre very affordable fifty bucks and they cover all the basics so a decent Bluetooth connection I find them to be pretty comfortable not the most comfortable at your buds Ive ever tried out but certainly comfortable enough for 50 dollars they have okay audio quality plus they have three different audio profiles so you can cycle through like balanced the signature one which youll probably like the most and then they also have a bass boost so they have okay audio quality they also have pretty good battery life so three and a half hours on a single charge and they come with the charge case that gets you about an extra 10 hours they are ip55 certified which means water and sweat resistance but my least favorite thing about them is probably the remote system and youll see this as a recurring theme whenever I try any true wireless earbuds it could be expensive one its like somehow the remote system because you just dont have a whole lot of real estate to work with just isnt that great so they do have a button its not very clicky its not very tactile and you do end up pushing the earbuds farther and farther in your ear so the remote system works its just not my favorite and it wont be my favorite on any of them because most of the time the remote systems arent that great on top of that when you go to take phone calls they wont take the phone calls in stereo mode they only take them in mono mode so you can take out one of the earbuds I think its the left one you can take out or the right one you could take out I cant remember off not my head but one of them you have to take out when you take your phone calls thats actually really common though for true wireless earbuds usually you can only take your phone calls in mono mode so I guess they can qualify as one of those 2008 Bluetooth headsets from like jawbone or something but seriously for 50 dollars I do think theyre probably the best ones that you can get right now now my second pick are under 45 and I really like them but I dont like them as much as the J buds air so I went with the taotronics TT so at out rocks pretty well known brand I think like Sunnyvale brands owns them or something but they make a lot of electronics on Amazon so I wear these and I do think they check a lot of the basics so yes they are comfortable they do come with a charge case that doubles as a power bank of 3500 milliamp hour power bank so it can charge your other electronics so thats actually really nice I said theyre comfortable the thing I dont like again is the remote system so they dont have a clicky or tactile button it is a touch capacitive system which kind of sucks so like double tap skip a track that sort of thing I think you are more than capable of mastering it I just dont think youll like it now these are also ipx7 certified which means you can drown them in water down to a meter and they should be good to go like we didnt have any issues with you know water and that sort of thing so they are fully water and sweat resistance they have bluetooth 50 and we were really expecting it to have unbelievable Bluetooth range instability but really its kind of just average like a lot of these cheaper true wireless earbuds its like 30 feet and then they will disconnect but thats I think thats like the baseline of what you can expect and you can probably get that from all the cheap true Wireless your about so like 30 feet regardless of the fact that they have bluetooth 50 that said the inter bud connection is pretty good you always will encounter some disruptions but its pretty good between the two different ear buds so the reason I went with these is that for anybody thats really pennypinching and you dont spend 50 45 dollars for these maybe saves you a little bit of cash and theyll still be good for commutes for the gym for workouts you just cant expect everything theyll be pretty good a little tinny kind of shallow in terms of audio quality but theyre okay my next pick are this Inari z5 so of all the brands on this list I know the least about Inari in fact I would have originally put on some ear buds from sound Petes we did it last year I love those ear buds I tried to find them I cant find them if you check in the description Ill link all of these Ill try to find the sound Petes but they had basically the exact same form factor as these and the reason I like them is that they have a very secure fit almost like like the powerbeats 3 so they go around your ear and they secure perfectly in your ear you dont have any issues so theyre really great for workouts and I think they do a decent job with the remote system so youll notice that they do have a center button but they have buttons on the top for volume so it means that they have a little bit more room for you to increase the volume or mess around with tracks and all of that so I like the form factor of these a lot they are 40 so I guess youre not saving a whole lot over the taotronics and again I would have preferred the sound Petes like the original sound piece that we talked about last year but these are the closest that youre gonna get I think theyre pretty freakin awesome though my least favorite part though is that they have a proprietary charger which Ill try to get shots this but at magnets onto the bottom Im guessing for waterproofing purposes and it means that you have to have like some unknown charging cable they have to they give you two just in case you lose one but it just its kind of weird to use some random charge cable youve never used before in your life so I preferred how the sound Petes did it where they had a microUSB cable and you have to press and hold each time to connect them its not that big of a deal but you have to do it every single time you want to pair them from their bluetooth quality pretty good like 30 feet and then enter earbud pretty stable from their audio quality its basically the same its so close across a lot of these earbuds probably the best on the J lab J buds but for these its decent really liked any kind of shallow easy to distort the bass but um I guess you know if I was working with a budget of like 40 bucks and I wanted to work out with true while this earbuds I would be very happy with these they do a battery life of about four hours on a single charge thats pretty good they are ipx7 certified and they obviously dont come with a charging case because they use the cable and my next pick or the cheapest on list and I really like these because theyre like 30 the sound Petes true free now sound Petes also makes another model thats a really similar theyre the cue 32 s but those come with a charge case thats also a power bank I think you can save money save like ten fifteen twenty dollars and get the true freeze which are I believe the most popular true wireless headphones on Amazon so these things are pretty great I mean Johnny G behind the camera here the ease the one this is the ones you used right yes yeah I mean theyre pretty awesome and one thing I appreciate is that they actually have a button thats pretty clicky attack Donna can we hear that yeah you can hear that okay yeah so its got a nice little button there that I really appreciate they have battery life of about three and a half hours on a single charge plus I think like 10 or 11 in the charge case theyre not waterresistant thats one thing you can wear them at the gym you just dont want to dump them in water or wear them in the rain or anything like that and as far as overall bluetooth stability goes yes they have bluetooth 50 but its pretty much the same as with the taotronics right 30 feet then youll have some sort of signal interference but inter earbud connection is large pretty good I think though for 30 these are the best true wireless earbuds you can get like I said Ill link them all in the description I apologize for not being able to find the around the ear ones that I love but I think I found a nice alternative Albia from a somewhat smaller brand oh and make sure to check out our

guys Im Jeff razzle dazzle possibly better known as Jeffrey the jet today were doing our annual video about the best workout headphones now if youre new to the channel you should know that we have tested dozens of headphones from some of the biggest and smallest brands out there and Ill link some of those reviews down below in the description and while youre down there make sure to hit that big red subscribe button you know youre probably gonna love everything that we have planned for the future and we just hit 100 million views its pretty incredible you know we also have a monthly giveaway Club where we end up doling out a bunch of really nice headphones if you want to figure out how you can enter to win check out everything in the description basically it all starts by you subscribing anyways so these are our favorite workout headphones at least according to our team obviously there are a lot of headphones out there a lot of really good ones we cant pick them all but these are the four best now I will put a list of some honorable mentions down below in the description as well but I doubt youll need it because theres no better than the best lets get to it Music okay so enough with the windup lets get right into the list I should tell you though at the end of the video well talk about my personal favorite our best overall workout headphones this year first up though we have the beats power beats 3 and these are what Im calling our safe pick yes theyve been out for 2 plus years but if you dont want to do any research and you just want a solid pair of workout headphones these are the ones to get you can stop watching the videos now theyre not perfect but theyre definitely good enough for most people they have great battery life its like 12 hours on a single charge and they have a quick charge feature like 5 minutes well get you an hour worth of play back the audio quality its passable the fit I think its comfortable pretty secure they also are water and sweat resistance and they have great Bluetooth range and stability I think theyre just overall solid workout headphones I guess the big downside with the power beats 3 is that theyre pretty pricey the MSRP is 200 that said I have seen them for cheaper I think Ive seen them as low as 99 bucks Ill link them in the description you can check them out for yourself see if the price has gone up or down whatever you can also head on over to our website Rizzos calm or download our completely free iOS and Android mobile app what we do is every single day subscribers youre well aware of this but we source the 100 best deals now we dont sell anything we just find amazing deals on products you actually care about like from Bose Beats jaybird Apple and the list goes on and we save people a ton of money so the links to that stuff are down below in the description I really think youll like what were doing there and we update it every single day if not multiple times per day ok so next up are my favorite budget  your headphones and Ive mentioned these in several other videos they are the anchor sound buds slim plus now I personally have and use the sound bud slim plus sort of as like my backup headphones because I have to have backups of everything anyways these things are 30 bucks theyre one of the best selling headphones on Amazon Ill link them in the description they have a comfortable secure fit theyre good for the gym theyre good for phone calls theyre good for walking around probably not my favorite running headphones but theyre great for cycling now the alsa pretty good Bluetooth range instability and battery life is passable its about seven hours on a single charge and I think they fully charge in about an hour and a half now they are also IPX I certified which is like water and sweat resistance although as I learn with my first pair they are not rated for putting in the washing machine so dont do that still they have a 99 positive rating on Amazon and for 30 I really really like these headphones especially now because Im having to save for a wedding thats right baby Im getting married and if you want to see the engagement video Ill put that down below in the description now we have the best true Wireless workout headphones and Im going with the jlabbe epicair elite now these are the ones that Owen our boy here mister deadlift himself these are the ones he uses theyre pretty awesome we did do a full review of them and Ill put that in the description as Ive mentioned for pretty much everybody else but what you need to know is that theyre by a comfy secure fit kind of like the power beats 3 the audio quality is pretty good considering their true wireless sound isolation is on point the battery life is 6 hours on a single charge which is great for true wireless headphones and then they have an additional 32 hours of battery life inside their charge case which doubles as a power bank so you can charge your other electronics now I dont like the remote system its kind of finicky its almost always pretty bad on true wireless headphones but the wireless signal is good I mean both between the earbuds themselves and to your Bluetooth device so you can walk like 50 feet and you have a strong connection there they arent cheap but I wouldnt call 150 egregious in fact I think jlabbe is gonna be winning with these things were gonna win so much and last but most certainly not least mostly because theyre my favorite my best overall pick are the jbird Terra Pro which I just did a review of its not recency bias I just really like them Ill put that review in the description heres what you need to know about them they have great battery life its like 14 hours on a single charge and they have a quick feature so five minutes of charging gets you two hours of playback time theyre completely water resistant down to one meter so ipx7 certified you also get bluetooth 50 they have an excellent audio quality especially for a wireless workout headphones and within that jaybird app you can actually adjust the EQ settings Ive mentioned this in many many videos but I like the fact that if youre listening in a country you can customize the sound signature for country which I do and if youre listening to rap that rap crap you can put more bass or do whatever the kids do nowadays and so basically you can customize the entire EQ settings and it follows the headphones not your Bluetooth source so lets say you go from your phone to your laptop youre gonna have that same sound signature they also have a durable braided cord with an adjustable fit which they call switch fit so you can wear them in the around the ear position for workouts which I prefer and then in the under ear position for like phone calls or maybe even to like calm down at work the one thing that I dont really like about the Thar Pro is that unlike some prior jaybird products they dont come with foam ear tips now those are the pinnacle in my mind in terms of sound isolation and comfort and fit but they just come with silicone ones I think theyre passable theyre fine everybody will like them but me being a stickler and somebody that gets caught up on like random little things I wish that they had the foam ear tips and know they are not compatible with other foam tips from other jaybird products still they have a very secure comfortable fit even for extended use yes theyre a bit more expensive like a hundred and sixty dollars but for me theyre hard to beat the only thing I will say is that you if you dont want to pay up for the tarah Pro I would actually probably skip maybe the xforce and save a ton of money by getting the x3 I dont know if you guys can see that but I use these for over two years in fact I sometimes still use them and I prefer when you put them around your ears you can string it up the cable up against the back your head and it almost forms like a true wireless experience so yeah these are 160 but if you want to save some money and get a similar experience not all of the features of tarah Pro but some of them I think I see these for under a hundred bucks often and Ill link them in the description so thats my list let me know what you think like I said I do it every year and so Id appreciate your feedback I think Im 100 percent correct mostly because Im never wrong so Ill see you guys next time have a good day

"video_id": "RzvMR00kQ9Y", "Closed Captions": " hey welcome guys this video were doing a review of the sony MDR xB 650 BT Bluetooth wireless headphones thats quite a bit of a mouthful for the model number this is pure wireless headphones they are bluetooth compatible but they dont have a 35 millimeter auxilary wire unfortunately but thats kind of okay with cell phone players just not so great for some people that dont have Bluetooth compatible laptops this is priced at 129 us and 199 Canadian but I do suggest and candidly look for a sale price like I did Sony advertises that this has about 10 meter range which is about 32 feet Ill say thats pretty accurate unfortunately theres no traverse pouch included out of the box keep in mind these are based specialty headphones theyre designed for extra bass in fact its even written on the box I had a bit of a concern because these headphones are incredibly light they felt kind of cheap and I was afraid theyre gonna break fortunately thats not the case theyve actually survived with me through a few flights I put them in my bag every single day and that helps that day cups do rotate for easy portability and packing anywhere you need to actually pretty sturdy surprisingly the top band has a layer of cushioning so if youre someone that has very little hair or no hair at all you wont be irritated by the band because that soft cushioning is quite thick and feels nice the same can be said about the earphone cups theres a lot of thick cushioning like really really thick which makes it incredibly comfortable my ears only get hot after three to four hours of continuous use it doesnt matter which size head you have theres some great flexibility here the Flex in general is fantastic it doesnt feel like its going to break the ear cups themselves has some good rotation of going up and down they can rotate left and right so you pretty much set in regards to which head type you have and the bands do extend rather lengthly if needed while wearing on the headphones are rather comfortable theyre not too big and bulky and they actually look pretty attractive they have some really nice colors from Sony one thing thats really important to mean for a lot of people I guessing as well is if you wear glasses these headphones are still really comfortable they are not irritating at all I find them to be very comfortable and I one thing to keep in mind is that they are available in red and black colors as well I find that Sony did a great job of making them it rather attractive it doesnt matter which color you get a lot of the functionality and control is pretty much on the right speaker now starting on one far edge we have the LED notification which if its a solid red wall as charging means its recharging if its blinking means its turning a pair of Bluetooth pressing and holding the volume button for two seconds turns it on pressing and holding it for seven seconds turns it on and puts into bluetooth pairing mode theres a microphone which Ill get into later on theres a micro USB port for recharging the device and of course their volume control buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume and while its on your ears its actually easy to navigate because the plus volume indicator has this little notch on it so its easy to feel at all the glider is also a button so you can glide it you know forward or back for going to the previous track or the next track pressing it in will play or pause a song or pick up a call or hang up the call and all these buttons are pretty easy to navigate whilst on your head because theyre placed really well they all have the different type of feel to them so you can just kind of touch them naturally when its on your ear on the left side there is an NFC chip so if you have say a NFC compatible cell phone simply tapping yourself on what the Bluetooth headset will automatically pair it in one tap so these are on the ear headphone types so theyre not really designed to cancel a lot of exterior noise but they do is somewhat okay job but thats not really a big deal one thing is really important to me is when you have them on your collar keep in mind in this segment I have a pretty thick hoodie so the call is rather thick move my head left and right is still rather comfortable despite them being a little bit higher than usual putting the head down is a little bit of an annoyance just a tad bit because your chin will rub against the speakers and no fooling the speakers in is not a good idea because they tend to rub against your neck now sony advertises that the batteries in this device last about 30 hours and i have to say its pretty accurate based on my testing and results over the last few months now to recharge of the device sony does include a one and a half foot cord which is a micro USB cord unfortunate theres no power adapter sony wants you to recharge this device through a computer only which is incredibly weird to me i dont understand that so i do not recommend you hooking this up to say recharging through your cell phone or tablet charger as you might blow the battery just to be safe now it does take about three hours to fully recharge the battery which is really long but lets do some calculation one hour of recharging gives you then about 10 hours of playback when are recharged gives you roughly four to five hours of playback so the tradeoff isnt bad while the device is on even if youre listening to music pressing the power button just giving a quick tap well have an audio playback and tell you if the battery level is high low or medium as mentioned earlier theres a microphone and theres a pickup and hang up button on the side and based on my testing I noticed that the person on the other end of the call will complain that the person with the headphones kind of sounds a bit distant a little bit echoey furthermore if theres a lot of background noise its really difficult to hear what youre saying but I cant really complain as either designed or as headphones I just find as more as a bonus function as mentioned earlier these headphones are designed mostly for bass playback and they do a fantastic job of pushing bass its not overthetop so doesnt really ruin the song that youre listening to mids and highs are just okay but if you listen to something like say rock which maybe it doesnt emphasize a lot of bass for example it does not ruin the quality Im really impressed with the quality overall with these headphones increasing the volume like a crazy amount even if you want to go deaf honestly it doesnt distort Im actually really impressed that you know high volumes are still getting crisp clear sound when it comes to streaming TV shows or sports its just okay you cant really expect much right listening to movies were all still the same thing its just okay but when it comes to listening to action movies you could be in for at really one to say explosions because explosions tend to have a lot of bass behind them so overall these headphones are fantastic but they have some weird problems that kind of set it back it does not support axillary port now I know a lot of devices you can listen to music from you know like spud cell phones for example or Bluetooth compatible but what if one is to do it on your computer not all computers are Bluetooth compatible the other thing is that theres no traverse pouch included with this device you know they could included one it wouldnt cost Sony just a few dollars in manufacturing to add it in the box the other thing is that theres no power adapter including the Box weird doesnt make any sense overall its a great set of headphones worth checking out especially because they are wireless but those small things kind of keep it back

Sennheiser but Im talking about truly wireless earphones having better connection better battery life and slowly getting more hightech than ever before this video I have the jaybird vistas that jbert sent over this is the press unit that was showing in video here not the retail packaging so keep it in mind but as always being transparent Ill be going over both pros and cons like every video my assessment was not altered in any way at the time this video theyre going for a hundred and seventy nine dollars retail if you want to check prices click on my links down in that video description below for the most updated prices in real time you never know when these things might go on sale Im Jimmy with Jims Ruthie room and Im here to help you make that purchase decision welcome everyone to another video hey folks before getting started here it would mean the world to me if you guys can follow my social media handles at Twitter and Instagram the addresses should be on your screen right there now those are my personal accounts so you can follow my journey through life here hopefully it motivates you to pursue your dreams as well Ill place the links also in that better description just tap and follow that would help support my work thank you very much so folks lets get into the physical features first jaybird emphasizes they may be vistas as light and as small as they could compared to the competition indeed the vistas are small and they dont stick out of my ears but they are roughly equal to the best out there its not classleading but still very good comment down below on what you guys think how do these look now the ruggedness comes back but this time Jaipur claims its even more diesel this still has the IP 7 certification meaning this can be submerged underwater up to 3 point 3 feet and up to 30 minutes now I tested this and theres no issues so far this girl has that sweat protection against your salty and sour secretions here I were these in the gym had some nasty ears wet one that never fell out of my ear and two theyre still working fine well see overtime the new editions apron is calling its earth proof the earphones capsule is essentially sealed against dust and grit now if youre watching this video in the future here come down below and let us know if these things are still going strong now as for comfort and stability these do work well with the newest silicone design the are comfortable these earphones dont Jam into the ear canal for stability instead they fit snug on the outer opening of your ear and the rest of the body somewhat rests on the bottom of ear right here now I also test both the large ear fin here and also the smallest one which only has a little nub and as you can see on screen either one space in the ears really really well now also testing this inserting runs and other vigorous movements never had an issue with the earphones losing its audio seal now speaking of its seal please provide very good passive noise isolation now its such a bass on the button lay up this was not a hundred percent for me here you do get pause play and skipping forward on your songs but if you look at these awesome cards that I drew in aftereffects here its either or you cant have two actions that you might personally want for example I want to keep pause and play but I really want Google assistance so the only option I have is switching to double press for my voice assistant but then I lose the ability to skip a song now indeed you can use Google assistant to go forward and back on your play list but a double tap then you have to wait about a second or two here and then you say the command verbally out loud it just simply wasnt intuitive touch controls or at least at a minimum a physical button is preferable having all the actions at your fingertips would be the most ideal instead of picking and choosing here now what you also notice is lacking what the earphones its environmental passthrough you dont have your microphones kicking on where it pumps in your environmental noises for situational awareness now that feature is predominant on most other competitors and is perfect for runners who want that option or those who walk to work and want situational awareness so you dont get hit by a bus or a Toyota or someplace fats you just dont get it with the vistas now Jaber tries to make up for this by offering each earphone to work independently you can take either one of these earphones out and still have audio now getting into bluetooth performance I think we can finally say most competitors are very much making this effort here Bluetooth 50 is featured and the connection is excellent with your phone jbird implemented this thing called jbs one wireless technology in hopes to fix connectivity issues testing this with it by 1100 square foot apartment here Im able to get 98 coverage with the signal going through several walls over here now with video on both Apple and Android for both YouTube and Netflix that I tested all of them play perfectly with no syncing delays and that appears everything is fixed and I will admit it does seem to have improved over the previous generations but I did encounter an issue of having the earphones connect to another device jaybird says this cant remember up to 8 devices thats awesome here but switching between lets say my pixel to my iPhone and viceversa it can be spotty with no success at times or even at times it establishes the connection but then the audio stops playing for summary but the actions like pausing and playing volume adjusting and such it still works so just look out for that when youre switching devices now last but not least before I move from the signal performance here jaybird only has SBC we dont get apdex or higher to support higher resolution audio files and streams of course but as usually uh what I say here in specs arent everything so lets wait into the audio section Im gonna review so lets get into the battery performance here jaybird is climbing up to six hours of use per charge here with my testing at 50 vine from full to dead I get six hours in three minutes to be exact now you get additional 10 hours with each rechargeable carrying case giving you a total of 16 hours fast charging is available with five minutes on the charger giving you back an hour worth of playtime now these numbers are not industryleading but they are still on the upper end now speaking about this case right here this uses USB C and if you like minimalism or at least something not clunky the earphones and the case itself has this very slim profile here and it works really well also were keeping the earphones in place the magnets are quite strong now folks lets talk quickly about the app now this is no question one of the best apps in the industry Jabra Sennheiser in what Sony here has some great ones as well but what makes them all great though is how they make your earphones hightech so going on to the main page right here you have your presets for EQ settings the most anticipated and most unique feature is the personal EQ that the app can generate for you when you go through this for the very first time here the app will play a series of tones and hums here in various frequency ranges as soon as you hear that little hum click Next and if you go through the entire range the app gives you a personal EQ setting now somewhat similar to the newer phones that are reviewed before but this puts it in your hands you can say its been consistent for me and with my ears the app is usually suggesting here I prefer or I like upper bass and a slightly raised high frequency now from my experience and years of testing audio I know I personally do tend to like a little bit more bass in my music and forward upper mids the app is accurate in a general sense here but it sounds its a little extended for me I typically have to pull down both Peaks for it to be my sweet spot for those who are interested this is where I usually keep my EQ settings on this app but anyways overall for those who are not familiar with what they like this app although its not a hundred percent but it surely can give you a general sense but more my audio test very soon lets see how these sounds a little bit later continuing with the app here then back to the main page the next important section are you curated playlists that links to your Spotify account the last section of importance is the headphone screed which allows you to customize the buttons as I mentioned earlier now find my buds which is awesome here if you lose these things the app will show you where it was last seen the only thing though that I wished was available as if these earbuds itself Kim sure just in case these little things dropped under the bed sofa what have you here and you cant find it use the audible little chirp feature here and you can find it within the vicinity you dont get that here but at least we get this GPS geolocation finding feature now back it up voice prompts and tones are accessible in settings allowing you to hear things like battery level status in your earphones or tones when your earphones turn on or off this was also a welcomed positive feature as well but lets get into the audio related stuff here first up is the microphone test a lot of you guys always are interested in the phone call test before doing so please be sure to visit the video description and follow my personal social media accounts again for Twitter its JLo official and for Instagram my profiles Jimmy look official alright folks fire modes down the comment section and here we go I will admit these do pick up a lot of background noise but also note though the microphones arent necessarily fighting to isolate my voice with the background so its not 100 perfect but then it give or take do you want consistent voice performance but unfortunately picks up background noise or do you want that kind of like cutting in and out experience so guys let me know down the comment section below what you guys think of how these your phone sound all right back to the studio all right now jumping into audio performance now for those who are familiar with jbird its a very similar experience loud in your face alive and energetic its perfect for pop EDM in hiphop starting with base these are bass boosted even in its stock level of course you can bump this up to a pretty significant degree with the EQ either flat or increased jaybird offers a very punchy and fast bass experience because of how well you can tune these this can go from flat or neutral to bass boosted and spilling over to the midrange or you can actually have a go overboard or actually have it very much underwhelming the level of customization offered can very well satisfied those on either spectrum for bass either light or bass boosted now getting into the midrange I love how separated forward and bright these cant become vocals and instruments have the ability to stand out not only being in the forefront of your music but audio separation from the lows and behind frequencies now as I mentioned earlier in my other review specs doesnt mean everything and although this only has SBC the engineer and how the audio is experienced is where it really matters the clarity is there now as for high frequencies its good but can be sensitive at times on select songs with tracks that have a lot of instruments beads vocal work on the very upper end there it can get slightly jumbled for the most part its never been bad I never experienced any ear screeching tinging or rasp enos up top now at this price point the sound stage is good and has a moderate degree of openness to be upfront the bose sound support frees and sennheiser truly wireless Momentums do a slightly better job in offering that spatial experience so overall for the price functionalities rug this size the jaybird vistas are really really good there are some shortcomings the parent to another device here was slightly funky on very few occasions and the lack of that environmental awareness as a feature was a bit of a letdown as well but everything else about these earphones Im very much enjoyed if youre on the market I would give these in recommendation or at least a consideration if you can work around those shortcomings there folks be sure to follow me on social media again the addresses are on your screen in in the video description below as always light up the comment section more fire mogees and I will catch you on the next one bye",

about the five most legit features of the beats X Wireless these are the latest headphones from beats and I think that youre really going to like them and we wanted to cover the best features about them before we get into it make sure you subscribe youre going to love this channel were rolling out a lot more reviews and all sorts of other great content that youre going to love so if youre in the beats products youre going to be into this channel red button is down below lets get to it alright before we get into number one if youre looking for a banking deal on beats products jaybird running shoes computers technology outdoor products check out rizz nose comm I can almost guarantee you we will find a discount on these or some other comparable headphones right now so check out resumes column thats our website were going to scour the internet to find you the best deals and everything the link is here on the screen click it when you get a chance alright on to number one and number one on the list is magnetic earbuds so I love the form factor of these headphones the concept of these headphones youre supposed to be wearing them all day long I think of my good friend Brian who runs a limo company hey they just hang around your neck and when you need them you pop them in you take that phone call you listen in your music whatever I think of the office work or somebody that just wants to have headphones on them all day long and its super convenient to just put them in and out of your ears and the fact that they have little magnets at the end of each bud means you can always find your headphones so a nice little addition theyre having magnets of the tips good job beats number two we get fast fuel charging it shows up again on the BTEC we saw it on other beats products thats where you plug these guys in for five minutes you get a full two hours of playback time on that which is awesome its like mind blowing fast feel charging one of the best thing since sliced bread huge fan of that and we plug them in for like nine minutes 10 minutes 12 minutes something like that and it charged them all the way up to 75 so if youre wondering they charge very quickly I think its like right around 40 minutes 45 minutes and you an entire full charge and just in case youre wondering about that whole battery life on these guys is eight hours so pretty good we actually were getting just over eight hours so decent battery life not amazing but for headphones this small with a tiny form factor thats pretty good battery life and these are the first beats product to feature a lightning port so thats how you charge them with your iphone cable makes it super convenient you only need one cable to charge these when youre traveling or you know daily as opposed to always having a second cable on you I think that it made sense for beeps to go with a lightning cable here coming in at number three is the pairing process again weve seen this on the other beats product and that is they are mindlessly easy to set up you hold one button down for like one or two seconds you pair it with one device thats connected to your iCloud account and youre set up you dont have to do it again you go to set up on your iMac or your macbook and these headphones are already ready to go so I like to think about these as being grandma proof thats not true Matt Ross coined that phrase so Im going to give him credit for that Matt Ross says their grandma oh sorry friendly grandma friendly thats how easy these are to set up I love the pairing process much more simple than other headphones out there that is if youre an iOS user if youre not an iOS user you probably shouldnt look into these headphones even though they will work with your device its just that the pairing process some of the other advantages means that youre going to be an iOS user if you get a beats product going forward number four wheres number four let me know if you actually get that reference write me in the comments number four is the sound isolation is awesome youre not going to hear your boss whos yelling at you on the daily because the sound isolation is really good they completely seal off your ear canal and for me the fit is pretty good although your ears are different from mine Matts ears are different from mine and that means that you know person to person that is going to be a little bit different for me I like that theyre contoured so they fit nicely into my ears and if you really do need a little bit extra in terms of getting them to fit and stay in your ears beat sends along a few extra ear fins so can help with locking them in your ear but I think the sound isolation is bar none I think I mean its not even active found isolation its just the fact that the buds completely seal off your ear canal and then also the fit is pretty good and I think these are some of the best beats out there in terms of the sound quality I mean not a great Ive obviously heard better buying the mids are pretty good highs are pretty decent and the lows obviously the bass is pretty darn good on these even when you get to those higher volumes now here and there you can hear distortions you get sounds a little bit shallow and raspy and muffled but pretty good audio quality on the beat sax last up here is something that was a little bit surprising to me and that is that they have an inline remote in mic so typically on these type of headphones youll see the buttons and everything right here on the neck cable went on the beats X its here on the main cable that does a few things for you makes it a little bit more convenient to access buttons for track management and volume and Siri and pause play love that and it means that when you plug them in you have them right into your ear here the microphone is closer to your mouth so the sound for the person on the other side I actually just played a song right there the person on the other side of the phone call actually hears you a little bit better so I think those are smart move by Beats to incorporate that into these headphones so those are the top five features of the beats X wireless heres my verdict on them if youre into these types of headphones youre down with the around the next portion youll like having headphones youre going to wear all day long I think these are a pretty clever option this is not super rigid but I think it keeps its form factor good enough theyre not workout headphones theyre not sweat resistant so if youre thinking about using them at the gym I think theyll be fine but you probably should look into other headphones like the power beats 3 which by the way weve seen some discounts on or some jaybird products so if youre thinking about them for the gym you might look elsewhere there all day wireless headphones other things when youre looking at these is the bluetooth stability in the range so I mentioned the pairing process is super easy but also when youre using them I think the range is pretty good right around 100 feet and then you will here disruptions and then the stability is pretty good too so walls and doors and people wont really get in the way unless youre on like the fringes the outer edges of what these can take in terms of the limit of the Bluetooth so I think pretty decent Bluetooth with these headphones at a hundred and fifty dollars that might be you know the deciding factor price point if you like them enough 150 might be right I think the price point is pretty decently moderate but thats up to you write me down below in

discuss the top features of these Beats headphones Yes Beats by Dre and Beats audio are expensive but these could definitely be perfect for someone who is looking for a pair of Beats wireless headphones or Beats eaurbuds to wear all day long However I wouldnt go as far as putting them on the list for Best Beats Headphones or Best Wireless Earphones just yet The top features of these Beats by Dre wireless include their magnetic buds and form factor fast fuel charging capability and that they charge via a lightning cable The Beats X Wireless earbuds also have 8 hour battery life they pair will apple devices extremely easy sound isolation is solid audio quality is pretty good and the inline remote and mic are very easy to use The range and Bluetooth stability are also pretty good with these Beats X Headphones Overall we really like these headphones Do not get these to work out in as they are not sweatproof and thus will probably not be considered for the Best Workout Headphones 2019 They are probably better for someone in an office all day or who drives a lot When it comes to BeatsX Wireless vs Powerbeats3 Id personally choose the Beats Powerbeats3 myself but for some people they may choose the BeatsX in the BeatsX versus Powerbeats3 discussion Im not sure if these will make the list for Best Wireless Headphones 2019 or Best Bluetooth Headphones 2019 Hope you

today we are going to unbox and take a look at a new pair of wireless headphones and when this company reached out to me I was actually feeling a little nostalgic because I actually owned a pair of their headphones back around middle school time so its been a while since Ive tried out a pair of their headphones and they are going with the wireless headphone trend truly wireless as you can see that company is Skullcandy they came out with the indie wireless headphones which we are going to unbox and take a look at today I do want to give a shout out to skull candy they are the sponsors of this video and also thanks to them for sending these over to check out its also worth mentioning that these headphones are competitively priced at 7999 I will link to them down below so were gonna take a quick look at what comes in the box of the indie headphones along with the easy pairing process with them as well lets go ahead and get started Music to begin wed like to show off what you get inside the box with these indie headphones on the front up to 16 hours of batterylife ip55 dust and water resistant rating and they have touch controls so if you go ahead and open this up lets you know how you can pair the headphones and also how to use those touch controls to change the volume skip tracks and play pause on the right side here you get your carrying case and of course your indie headphones underneath the headphones you do have your user guide along with a USB type aid a micro USB cable and some extra ear tips as well if you have a different sized ear so that these headphones will stay inside your ears so heres a look at the carrying case that you get says Skullcandy it looks like you have three LED indicators which will let you know the power status of it and the case will actually charge your headphones when you put them inside up to 12 hours of usage charging out of the pack itself and then you do have the charging slot down at the bottom theres a bit of a magnetic mechanism to the lid so you dont really have to worry about it flying open it will actually stay shut finally the Skullcandy indie headphones themselves youll see the logo is where you will use those touch controls also worth mentioning it does come with some extra tips here which you can take off if you do not need them however Im going to leave them on to help it be a little bit more stable in my ears putting the headphones in the carrying case themselves youll see right away it actually activates those indicator lights on the headphones and on the battery case letting you know that it is now actually charging your headphones finally lets go through the pairing process so press and hold these two for about four seconds and youll see this LED indicator lights start to blink now Im gonna go ahead and grab my phone turn on Bluetooth and it should be able to find it there it is in D just go ahead and select it to pair and there we have it it looks like it is connected for calls and audio 50 battery remaining so I will need to put it back in the case to actually charge it and we are all set ready to go that was actually really simple to pair with my phone these indie headphones are also very light so Ive never had a problem wearing them for an extended period of time when I am moving around a lot you can really barely notice them and they also never fall out they suction very well in my ears also which adds to the noise isolation that they have the noise isolation is very good so whether youre trying to study in a loud coffee shop or youre sitting on an airplane this does a good job at isolating that sound thats coming through the headphones because it really does block out that sound around you I find its really helpful when working out because it really isolates the music coming to your ears so you can really just focus on the music and getting your lifts in and speaking of working out like I said these have that ip55 rating so if you are starting to sweat or you get sweat or a little bit of water on these you dont have to worry about them breaking the indie headphones have bluetooth 50 and also a 33 foot range so you generally dont need to have your phone on you at all times when listening to music or even a podcast anything like that so if you want to set your phone down somewhere or whatever youre connected to walk around maybe you run over to the kitchen get some water anything like that dont have to worry about bringing that specific device with you so your headphones stay connected now when it comes to touch controls on these headphones pretty simple the right one if you just tap it once youll see on my phone it will start to increase the volume and the left headphone will decrease the volume so pretty simple just left right you got a nose up and down same easy concept for going to the next track or the previous track just press and hold for two seconds let go and itll go ahead and skip the song and finally the last one is only for the right earbud just go ahead and double tap and it will go ahead and pause the song and if you do it again it will start to play again overall the touch controls were very easy to get used to just placing your finger the right spot it has a good amount of surface area to find where you actually need to touch overall the only gripe I have which isnt really that big of a deal is that you can only play pause with the right one so maybe Im holding something in my right hand I kinda have to transfer over to my left hand so I can double tap the player pause not that big of a deal just kind of wish you could do that on both of them worth mentioning these touch controls can manage your calls as well and speaking of phone calls Ive called a few different people and asked how does it sound whats the quality like and everyone is said good so has been no complaints with call quality with these headphones so that is everything Im going to talk about for the Skullcandy indie headphones I will link to them down below keep in mind these arent the only color options that you do have there are multiple ones and thats about it so hopefully you enjoyed the video be sure to click that thumbs up button drop a comment as well let me know you think about the indie headphones and as always guys thank you very much for watching", "video_title": "Skullcandy

headphones you want the best right well you have come to the right place hey there Im Caleb Denison for digital trends and that cheesy intro was brought to you by coffee coffee Ive had way too much of it okay enough of that nonsense lets get down to the business of laying out the best headphones you can buy in 2020 so far this list will change later this year and well have to shoot another video but for now these are all really solid picks we test tons of headphones every year many of us are musicians some of us musicians who travel a lot some musicians who exercise a lot Im definitely not one of those people some of us have kids some of us game and wouldnt you know it theres a headphone out there for just about every need so before we get to the very best headphones you can buy lets look at the best in a series of categories and we start with the best ear buds you can buy under a hundred bucks that honor goes to the one more triple driver ear buds these things have no business sounding so refined at this price point in fact they redefine what you should expect from any headphone under 100 the name refers to the fact that there are three individual transducers in each bud and theyve been expertly tuned to sound like a 3 or 400 pair of headphones theyre comfortable compact theres an inline mic included and at 80 bucks they are a nobrainer get them next lets talk about the best true wireless earbuds and our choice might surprise you right now were going with the Amazon echo buds yes I know there are far better sounding true wireless earbuds and if you want to spend a lot more go for it but we like these because they are true Wireless buds that everybody can get behind and most can afford at just 130 bucks you get solid sound quality Bose noise reduction good call quality and well average battery life at about 5 hours with another 15 hours of charging coming from the case for the price you cant beat this feature set now a close second in my opinion is the Samsung Galaxy buds plus within insane 11 hours of playtime for charge and decent sound in a very compact but they dont sound as good as Amazon spuds but they get the job done and theyre also only a hundred and fifty bucks next up are the Apple earpods Pro which are the best buds for iPhone users but honestly if you have the money and can wait to get a parent since they are chronically out of stock do it because and I still cant believe Im saying this about an Apple earbud these things are awesome the active noisecancelling is best in its class they are pretty comfortable battery life is about average and the sound quality is more than acceptable I actually like it just fine audiophile grade no thats for the next set of buds but overall these are some of the highest performing pair of true Wireless buds you can get right now and for most folks they take all the right boxes if you are serious about sound I mean you want the best sound you can get from a pair of wireless buds with decent battery life and really solid noise cancelling then you want to look at the sony WF 1000 xm3 these are luxurious and like I said the sound quality is fantastic so if thats your number one requirement buy with confidence oh and youll need about 200 bucks for the pleasure thats a lot of buds but how about some fullsize cans well for music lovers were all about the Sennheiser HD 650 which you can also get from mass drop as the HD 6x X for 200 these things sound amazing its everything you expect from Sennheiser in the sound quality department for a shockingly low price they are open backed headphones so not the best pick for office use people will hear what youre listening to but the open back design allows for extremely Airy transparent and open sound with solid base and a midrange that is so pure youll feel like youre hearing your favorite singers for the first time got kids get them these I got these for my kids and they love them these are the Pierrot sound labs Pierrot quiet cans and they will not only protect your kids ears but they shut out the outside world with active noisecancelling all in a kid sized wireless headphones they come in three colors they sound great and theyre a hundred bucks I mean what more do you need now for the best of the best this may come as no surprise as they top a lot of headphone lists they are of course the Sony WH 1000 xm3 right now you can get them for about 300 and the best endorsement I can give them are that they are my personal favorite I take these everywhere I fly a lot the noise canceling is outstanding the sound quality is fantastic the battery life is excellent theres almost nothing I dont like about these I will say that the one thing that tends to disappoint people is that they only connect to one device at a time also this pigtail charging cable is virtually useless these are the two things I want so need to address with the next version of these headphones which will come out later this year even when the next version does come out though Im still going to be suggesting these because the price will go down while supplies last making them an even better slamdunk I will say that if youre a hardcore business type who takes a lot of phone calls with your headphones you might want to check out the Bose ANC 700 they are super comfy they sound great have excellent noise cancelling but most importantly they do phone calls really well the Sonys just arent that great attack couple of honorable mentions for work out headphones check out that jlabbe epic air sport or the Jabra elite active 75t both are excellent waterproof solid fitting options with lots of fitness perks builtin also for you gamers out there we are big fans of the Astro 850 which sound incredible have an excellent mic and are comfortable enough to wear all day which you probably will thats our list folks what do you think leave a comment down below about your favorite headphones like subscribe bring that

bracket so Ill leave a link to that video so some of the headphones that you may not see here will be available in that video all the links to everything featured in this video will also be in the description below so you can go ahead and quickly buy these products lets start off with the first pair of headphones first about the Jack Martin h1 11 Bluetooth wireless headphones these are pretty impressive looking headphones weve got them in the black and red color theyre priced at eighteen hundred and ninety nine and they are also the cheapest headphones on our list before we get into the audio quality you will see that the build quality of the headphones is pretty nice its got padding all over its got soft comfortable foam pads on the ear cups as well as comfortable foam padding and wrapped padding on the headband it also has a metal headband which is quite flexible and overall the headphones are extremely lightweight as well they have a 250 ml amp hour battery which delivers up to 10 hours of music playback another interesting feature of this is that it does have inbuilt LED lights which is absolutely fantastic so just the single click of a button will enable the LED lights on the side of the headphones which will make them look funky if that is something that youre into now they do have bluetooth 42 they are extremely lightweight and as far as the audio quality is concerned they are pretty impressive in terms of the bass and overall sound quality is pretty impressive considering the price tag if you are looking for something that gives you a good quality lower end of the audio spectrum these headphones are definitely the ones they do come with an included 35 mm cable for those who are interested in using the analog side of things and you can also charge the headphones using a standard micro USB port so allinall pretty impressive and especially the light feature is something that a lot of people would be interested in go check these out next up on our list are the brokest urban bluetooth headphones these cost nineteen double nine and previously we wanted to feature them in our previous video but at that time they were priced much higher at 2999 but now theyre available for 1999 which makes them pretty impressive for the price that theyre available at now or these are the only headphones that come with an extra set of washable pads so if your earphones or ear cups get dirty you can simply throw them into the washing machine while you use the secondary pair that is included inside the box these are easy to swap out the ear cups as well so if you do damage one set you always have an additional set these headphones allow for two devices to be connected at the same time so you could switch between a Bluetooth enabled television and a smartphone quite easily if that is something that youre looking for the headphones are quite well built theyre extremely lightweight and durable they do have a rubber headband padding along with soft foam cups like I mentioned they are swappable they will last about eight to ten hours in terms of the battery life along with 10 meters of distance pretty impressive you do have an inbuilt microphone a 35 mm headphone jack play pause buttons and volume controls directly on the headphones as well the overall sound quality is wide and you can get a good soundstage on these headphones they are not bass heavy theyre more known for clarity so if you are looking for clarity in your headphones these ones will definitely be a good option next up on our list for a price of 2499 are the invent saver 630 these are the only overtheear headphones in our list and might I say they are rather comfortable the headphones have a really soft comfortable protein ear cushion on the ear cups and the headband is flexible and adjustable so you can get big heads into these headphones without any problems since the design is over the ear itll sit comfortably around your ear and not pressing down too hard making them rather comfortable for long periods of time the headphones come with a 320 milliamp hour battery and it can be fully charged in about two hours lasting for up to 13 hours as far as battery life is concerned these are also the only headphones in our list that do come with a included carry case a hard good protection carry case is also included which makes it a plus for these headphones also the auxiliary port is still on these so if you are not interested in using them wirelessly you can also use them in a wired fashion these headphones also support two devices at the same time and of course a2dp as well as far as the soundstage is concerned again its extremely wide not very bass heavy but if we tweak around with the equalizer a little bit you can improve the bass if that is something that youre looking for the standard sound stage is pretty good and good amounts of clarity good amounts of sound now finally in our list are the JBL T 450 Bluetooth headphones now these cost two thousand four hundred and ninety nine and theyre actually on sale there originally for upwards of three thousand bees so in fact if you go and look for the blue color today they still cost more than three thousand rupees now these are the only headphones that do not have a 35 mm headphone jack so if thats something that youre looking for these headphones do not have it the build quality is also pretty plastic based because the headband does not have any kind of padding the ear cups however are the softest in the list of the headphones that we have over here and the ear cups are nice and bendy so you they make it easy for you to flatten them out and travel with them they do have 32 mm dynamic drivers and to get a really good quality sound along with really good quality lowerend on these headphones the best sounding audio along with the best sounding bass are can be had from these headphones again you do have controls directly on the ear cups as well as an inbuilt microphone and a micro USB port for charging these out of the for headphones featured here the JBL headphones are the most flexible can be folded flat completely and also offer up the maximum amount of pace it is also worth noting that both the brokest urban as well as the Jack Martin headphones are not bendable so you cannot hold the ear cups at all and they have a fixed ear cup design you can extend the headband but thats about it they will not fold flat and the JBL headphones in our list are the only headphones that will completely fall flat the invent Sabre will also fold flat thats how they fit inside the case so thats it for this video guys if you have any questions or queries to drop them in the comment section below if you like the products from this video they are all linked in the

right whats going on boots energy here today and if you purchased one of these Bluetooth wireless headphones over here that look somewhat like these they come in different colors and I want to know how to pair them to a lets say Samsung Galaxy Note 3 well youre in the right video so todays video is basically about pairing these headphones to a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and with that said lets get to the parent process pretty simple and first things first lets turn on the Bluetooth settings over here and youll find or it says bluetooth over here if you just use the drop down menu once you see it go ahead and tap on it once then this window will now kind of open up for you so you can see whats going on and youll have the option to scan but dont do that yet because our next step is to power on the headset so that when youre scanning you can actually pick up the headset ok and this headset in particular has a individual unique button for on and off ok so theres no need to hold down any button or anything its just simple switch where you just power on and sure you might have heard that tones sound play just now and the good thing about these is that as you powered on they go into this pairing mode for you automatically so theres no need to hold down any button and get it into pairing mode now once youve made it to that point the next step is to go ahead and scan on your phone so you can actually pick up the headset give it a couple seconds and just so you know youre not gonna see wireless headphones youre gonna see this number code number kind of mixed with letters here called NX 8 2 v 2 and thats what were looking for so once once we see it got a tap on it once and its going to pair for you automatically just give it a couple seconds and you might have heard that tone sound as well meaning that its officially connected and youll see the text now and blue also connected to phone and media audio and thats basically it for this guide if it was helpful dont forget

whats going on people all right jbird run XTS theres some things that they kept in some things they mildly changed are the improvements worth upgrading and how does it compete with the competition as always being transparent with my lovely audience here what is up team James Revere was fired modis for you guys jbird did send this over for a review but my assessment was not altered in any way Ill be going over both pros and cons the last this is priced at 179 dollars retail but I place my affiliate links that in that video description below click on those links for the most updated prices in real time you never know when these things might go on sale Im Jimmy with Jims review and Im here to help you make that purchase decision welcome everyone the video Applause Music alright folks lets go over the physical features first and see what those subtle changes are first we receive a slightly redesigned ear fin theyre much more curved or angled than before and when I tested the original runs I was clear and transparent with you guys and admitted they kept falling out of my ear during my jogging sessions most likely my ears are a little bit weird but when I compared them to all the other competitors I reviewed so far on this channel Ive never had that issue and sorry about the cringy faces in the video here but this time around they stay in perfectly fine and they do give me confidence that they wont fall out and I know I look a little bit weird in the video right here but after testing these shaking them vigorously they stay in not to mention they look really damn good black and black is killing it now getting a closer look for those who are unfamiliar with the jbird runs there are physical buttons for pairing turning them on and off and such theyre all very responsive and very clicky now each press is light enough so when you have these in your ear youre not actually like jamming these earphones into your head here again very subtle clicks awesome now most of the functionality from the button presses are all there although I do appreciate having Google assistant in the left ear bud or Siri that is at my fingertips but what we dont have or all the features available at the same time here let me reach into my pants in them so within the app you have to choose in the settings other default controls or alternative controls as you guys can see here now if I choose default controls you get Google assistance or Siri which is awesome but you only have pause and play you cant use that left earbud that is over here to adjust your volume down now same thing with your right ear but I can pause and play but then I cant adjust the volume up I have to switch over to alternative controls and I know what your blood is off right there but whats up alternative controls its basically viceversa Ill lose the Google assistance or Siri and then it lose the pause and play feature unfortunately you have to pick and choose now this was a nuisance to me the less times honestly that I have to take up my phone that is the better during a workout especially during a run or simply having the convenience of just sitting at my desk right here and then if I need to adjust volume again dont want to whip out my phone you have to again pick and choose I wish a bird found a different way to do this now since Im still on the buttons here the only other feature that I found missing Jabra calls it here through Sennheiser themselves calls it transparency mode theyre run XTS basically doesnt include a feature like those other competitors they dont include a function that allows the outside environment the noses around you to be pumped in through the microphones for safety or simply awareness so with the run XTS these are 100 passive noise isolation earphones which I do love though and these do blackout a lot of noise these barely sound leaked as well but having the option for runners to hear their environment raw listening to music would have been nice now I dont know if you the consumer actually value this but comment down below let me know let all of us know if Im just being picky here but this is something runners actually use I personally think I personally use it again for safety reasons let me know if this is a feature that you guys desire yourself now the workaround and actually a plus for most people you have the ability to leave only one of these earphones in your ear if youd like with other ear phones such as again the Sennheiser Momentums true Wireless which I reviewed earlier this week you can only leave the right earphone in if you choose to leave only the left one in like I do with the Jaybirds here and the right earphone goes into your pocket or so its not going to work with the jbird run XTS you dont have that problem I cant I can confirm that you can either switch eitheror and put the other one in your pocket and you still have a year to listen out you know for whats going on around you now moving on the second change that makes the XTS better than the previous generation but more importantly better than most of the competitors is its ipx7 rating while most competitors have an ingress rating of around 4 or 5 many that theyre only splashproof or maybe at most spray proof the xt can be fully submerged in water up to one meter for up to 30 minutes now I wouldnt recommend swimming with these but these are now as rugged as the draw bras which also have an IP 7 rating as you see in the video I had this in water as well and theyre still functioning fine today now it would be cool though if these could float in water too but again for most people who are running along the street or so baby bike the woods youre probably not gonna drop this into the lake now getting into better life its still decent for hours and the earbuds themselves with another eight hours from the charging case so thats a total of 12 hours quick charge is available with only five minutes in the case and you can get up to an hour of playback back if that makes sense not pet at all now I did run my battery test at 50 in Vaughn to get in middleoftheroad result and I achieved four hours and 53 minutes which was very similar to the first generation since I briefly mentioned the case heres a closer look theyre not magnetized so once you put these earphones in here be careful because they could drop out now rotating to the back they still stuck a USB 20 connection for some reason were heading into 2019 and in my humble opinion I think a lot of consumers should be investing to USB typec since thats the next Universal ports most likely it is touching base on bluetooth performance now oddly were still at also Bluetooth 41 although Bluetooth 50 has been out for a while and older technology but lets see what my testing showed with signal strength Im able to achieve 82 linear feet of range with one wall in between and thats really good for an older Bluetooth technology testing this with video Android first I have a Samsung S A but I did have any video syncing issues with Netflix or YouTube thats a huge plus twitch on the other hand had horrible delays and Im aware these are dedicated support earphones but my viewers do watch the video with sport earphones to a testing this for those with iPhones Netflix was slightly off youtube and twitch was horribly off sync I also never had issues with the right or left ear but cutting out and not playing as well the last feature I wanted to talk about before discussing audio is a phone call performance my voice is audible and at the forefront which is great news but like most other earphones they do pick up a good bit of environmental noises so getting into the audio performance I really love the chambered sound signature not because its the most accurate if anything is the furthest from being accurate but its loud its in your face its great for pop EDM hiphop genres that I personally listen to you for those looking for balance or accuracy these are not really its but if youre looking for more of an alive sound signature thats what the jbert run X Ts are for starting with bass these are surely bass boosted earphones its fast thumping bass with some residents here its not deep thunderous bass but more than plenty for the after mention generous I would caution though the midrange is clear enough for most there is though an ever so slight amount of bass spilling over that prevents the midrange from shining a bit further but we can address some of this in the app which Ill show you shortly after testing a good bit of truly wireless earphones over the years I do notice the Jaybirds not having an expansive or having a wide soundstage the run X days have excellent left and right audio separation but that spacial miss is not there it doesnt take away from the music but a wide soundstage always helps with the experience now the high frequencies are not screeching or over piercing but could use a bit more resolution or detail overall and to reiterate though the jaybird run XTS these pair of earphones are very colourful in a sense and many average consumers will really really enjoy them if I can give you an analogy lets say The Avengers movie infinity war or endgame nearly all the background is on a green screen but the visual artists tweets it to be visually appealing they put in all that filler and stuff in this case jbert engineers tweak the audio to what most average consumers like hopefully you guys understood that analogy there but lets get into the app here let me not whip it out but without the phone that is right on the dashboard you have several presets right on the home screen now hands down go to the equalizer this is where you can adjust all your settings its very intuitive and very easy to use making an adjustment does not ruin the audio what I personally like is more for vocals more forward mids a little bit brighter right here so what I do is I just this up slightly to achieve my personal sound signature if you guys been farming for these years I like a slightly brighter sound signatures I should I usually leave it right around here I think there we go the jbird app now on the base level I do enjoy the base I just leave it exactly where it is but right here is where its at so next up here is the settings and define my bud option I love this feature not many competitors offer this but youre able to find your last location of where you last left your earphones now its not 100 precise but its a pretty good indication hopefully with its showing where you are it will show you or it will remind you on where you last left the every button that you can go back to the area and look for them and like I said most other competitors dont even offer this so overall in my personal opinion if you only previous jaybird runs and you dont need the waterproofing I would say dont upgrade now for these XTS despite not being the most technologically advanced sport earphones for those who dont currently own the original runs or at least had trouble with the original runs had trouble with them staying in your ears I think the XTS are executing at a very very good level were talk about battery life or tumble comfort and fit now and were talking about the IP seven rating not only that but a sound signature now the negatives such as the button functionality or lack of button functionality the lack of transparency mode video playback is somewhat shot there you can say an USB 20 and the case its one of those things where if you dont care for it or if you dont need it for video you dont care about the USB 20 and such the Jaybirds are still an excellent choice for the price the only other competitor that has an IP 7 rating thats a completely mainstream here is the Jabra elite sport that does come with some extra features all the button functionalities no USB typec though if I recall but keep in mind those do retail for 219 dollars its a little bit more expensive if youre in the 150 to 180 dollar price range the jaybird run XTS could be a very very good option for you Id say definitely check it out at least definitely check out the audio signature that they provide all right folks like subscribe and fire mochi that comment session Ill catch you on the next one Music", "video_title": "Jaybird Run XT 2019 Release

these wired you can do and this is a pretty cool cable Very nice its got this sort of stretchy bit in the middle as well Im not sure what you call it but thats very cool Right now lets get straight to the Major III As you can firstly see that theyre actually collapsed so theyre going to be great for transport and things Well expand these Got to say they look very very cool Weve got the Marshall logo here on both sides Right now lets go ahead and connect these up and see what they sound like Bluetooth on Major III Bluetooth done Nice and quick Feel really good and they do a really good job of

for this colleague we do that I mean its three do three do yeah we got a colleague here because Matt is here to show us an exciting new product from boss which might be tricky to to demo so I think its gonna be tricky to do what is it thats all I think were gonna have to judge on some reactions okay a reaction video we also need to say neither of us have seen these all tried them we have literally no concept of what this is so I just hope they they work and you enjoy them basically yeah right so what weve got is this pair of is which might give it away I guess the first wireless personal amplification system is what were calling it and how far up does it need to go before you personal amplification system okay so what we have is the boss air oh I like the vintage styling so I thought about me like Sony Walkman spongey you know stuff that looks great Oh feel that I mean faux leather presumably but they theyre nice oh man theyve actually made some nice so heading phones yeah Ive gotta say theyve you have absolutely the visual on those headphones yes so these are a completely wireless guitar amp system right in a pair of headphones for your up for only for use yes so if you imagine you know you cant I mean I live in a small flat in London or youve got family or kids and you cant play out loud this is designed to kind of allow you to actually have an enjoyable experience playing guitar to be first cheaper than to find a place with the studio attached to this so you dont have your you dont plug your guitar amp it is no they literally are the amp in the iPhone exactly but what makes them really unique is that obviously when you plug a pair of headphones into a PC or a phone if youre using an app but it kind of sounds pretty Undine ammok its pretty flat yes right a pretty decent sound but its not the same as playing and in a room so one thing you want is to feel that the air coming out you almost want to feel like youre in a space okay right great fan thats what this does so these actually have something that weve built in called Jarrah ambience using a sensor here and means fire its part of music is this gonna be like a black mirror moment when I put them on and then suddenly Im lost for the for eternity needless to say that headphone amps are not a new thing no but what this does is it actually places the amp in a virtual space so it moves it away from just the ears and then you can position that what in any way that you want some virtual reality amplifier I guess you could call it that in some way I mean Im intrigued because it and this is quite pertinent for me and guys who follow me or people who follow me on on my facebook and instead pages will know that its the pages insta pages will know that I had a helix Anna Kemper that I took home for a few nights each and just because the headphone experience was so unrealistic is that the right word because its its literally like you dont really appreciate until you put headphones on that what youre actually hearing with the guitar amplifier when you put it in a room is this massive sound created this by yeah and when you put headphones on its literally like sticking your head in between two speaker cabs and its just very unrealistic yeah so I ditched all that and went often used a little Yamaha THR amplifier instead I know I should have used a guitar around but I saw Im kind of intrigued to know whether or not this solves that unrealistic Iberian absolutely excited  yes so what obviously theyre pretty noise cancelling as well so when Im talking to you you probably not gonna be over here long so what Ill do is have a little bit of a play  and Ill show you that no wireless and its wireless as well so you can dock the house this house this running in just normal batteries or runs on lithiumion batteries that you can recharge so right in charge you get around five hours on the headphones so I can fly to America so ably shredding they start on the plane in first class 1100 so thats crazy okay Im hoping were gonna have you in genuine first reaction just turn on for me make sure they get the sound that I call it off set a pretty clean sound aw come on man yeah and then you can adjust it on the app so thats your volume control for your guitar right so you can roll up the volume here yeah these are for changing patches up and down slightly feel like an old person learning about something new dont touch the buttons yet okay and dont touch this but if you werent only going on  things dont touch things yet all right okay now so we just set up a pretty clean your own your screen recording your Im screen recording this is where is the up beat is there a headup display not yet not yet right so its just your clean sound yeah right so if you want to change the crunch we leave sound Wow right okay so yeah give them a lead sound yes a lead sound gain volume and then youve got all your effects on here as well so derive from the Gotama series boost modulation delay reverb happy sound yeah I couldnt like him hear it so they have this quite dislike yeah what so just take the headphones off for a sec okay so what when you play now what Im going to do is Im gonna put it in the first mode thats surround mode so now remove the amp into this space but I can physically move it around your head space oh well I like the stereo in my car where you can move it on yes so what youll hear is the amp in front of you right and then Im gonna move it by this is incredible so if people are watching this iPhone recording off means its working like toasting noise but a normal pair of headphones right okay so Ive put into surround made war Music so youre moving this Im literally moving the guitar as what did you do moved it from in front of him to the head so see when youre playing at home youre playing with the guitar amp in front of you but when you actually want to play live or rehearsal youre playing with behind him so you can physically move that position between ears as well okay Wow but can you turn off the reverb so I saw here a room yes we can turn off the reverb on the amp sound here and then you can also turn off the ambience down as well for the ambience controls how big the room is alright thats outside now take them off leaving beep all right so now what Im gonna do is Im gonna put it in the next mode thats static mode okay so what its gonna do is its gonna put the amp in front of you right but your head will fully control and its this so you can see here on the guitar position and at least the opinion guarantee that these headphones are noise canceling so I can say anything I like about robot yeah I can see your lips moving and I can hear something that was about it I said yeah plate place the amp so its in front so you can see now Music so you can see as it moves its moved in the militant positions always in front and its your head thats determining which direction you hear it Music its so its it is very effective in in tricking you to feeling like theres an amp physically there theres a tiny amount of lack of positional lag they eat that you can sense but if youre the sat it also sounds like its higher than it would normally be like but Im wondering if I yes I its interesting because although its in the same position you dont get the difference in the cone tone when you go higher mmm so its like its lightly amp is in front of my face yeah but that stays where it is those days put in a static so thats a physical control that you can change and you can again you can change the ambience so the more I turn up the ambience the bigger the space gets and then you can change that from a stage to a studio as well and that will change the kind of the feel for the room at work did you theyre not gonna hear any of this but can I have a British crunch and like hardly any ambience yes so you can basically we can go crunch can you replicate playing on like a really so you can set how you want so its just touchscreen so bass middle treble put all that mush Mitch what am i Music but you could effectively guard instruments how you dial in and whos gonna play stick bloody up that is just one to go that thats 93 92 you also get an actual amp so obviously the last thing is if you want to play you obviously want to play with a backing track command but when you play with a backing track youre always playing on top of the track youre never playing with the track right so what if we could place the band in a virtual space alongside the guitar playing everything is behind you like youre playing on the stage am I in a virtual space as well so youll also be in the virtual space so have you got a virtual wedge monitor that Rob could put its foot on like that yes yeah so if I load up the old Antons bar yes lets put the headphones on here this is a world first people we have this binaural microphone set which kind of hoping will replicate a set of human ears but if Im totally honest with you weve never done this before so who knows the headphones are now positioned over the years this part of the demo will only really work if youre wearing headphones as well okay Im just getting our iPhone just hold it I think as well like oh you know push for this we saw in Bobs reaction its like the hearing of them is really bling because when its in that headspace fire its so unbelievably crazy yeah and Im holding the stand because what Im gonna try and do is twist it like this so that you cant really affect but there is a tiny bit of handling noise like because Im you know if youll just have to try and do and keep the handling noise to a minimum but obviously you wont get that when youre wearing these on your head so lets go there so why dont I play the track first and Ill show you a bit of the ambience level but and also just the lovely audience know that were hearing its true speakers in the room yeah so if youre wondering how I know what to play yes because of that yeah so lets start the track Music my dog Music Applause Music I think that might be enough as as I said or as we all say we have absolutely no idea whether this style of demonstration has helped you appreciate what this is doing on you you guys are now gone okay Im gonna show you a couple other bits with the headphones real quick if thats all right lets put the yeah yeah I dont know what to do we cant you can mute though I know theyre kind of your speakers still a little okay so basically kind of same thing that you saw Rob doing at the beginning lets start Ill start with it off and then well dial in your amp sound okay and it will turn it on yeah speaking freely adjust it however you want yeah okay I mean its still got that sense its a do you know what its not it doesnt feel quite as in your ear as it did when I was using helix with no more headphones but its still its still oh so now ready Music Laughter Music so now its directly in front of him apart from literally apart from I dont know how long I particularly want to wear headphones you know like is that that enclosed sense and the heat that builds up in your ear tonally it is utterly different to wearing headphones normally yeah so a big thing is is that drivers are custom designs and the ear pads are custom design so its really built to not only give you a good audio experience like Bluetooth audio but also a good guitar playing its a katana on your head isnt it its a virtual critic you know whats interesting is without the surround technology is face without the surround technology when you first hear it its like this is like the best version of other headphones that we ever heard and then when its placed in the space its a whole new world yeah Celestes okay so this is the static mode so the answer weighs in front of you okay so the amps here I think the amps there yeah Ive got way more in this here ah say its always gonna be in the front so you need to face deadon youll see that oh I see stay on Thomas its a bit more its slightly unrealistic in the sense that its almost like youre outside and its like so theres the amp and as soon as you go like theyre like if youre in a real room I dont think youd hear that much difference but in the headphones as soon as you go there its like its going it we can turn down that by our gaze as well and we can change the space as well thats better thats cool all right I guess so much better okay okay Im gonna play you the backing track okay all right put the band behind them okay well go a minor this one all right the most interesting demo ever wins its so satisfying ours is the experience of Joe stage yes so you can change that for ambience that stage size so if I turn it up to max yeah dont plan anything just listen to Kate right listen for the drums in the background and then if I turn it down and now Im going to turn it off you know whats weird actually if you were to when youre listening to a backing track so youre listening to you know your music on your phone I can record it album off that that actually is what you would normally hit exactly off like with a backing track context doesnt sound worse it sounds like how you would expect it yeah its only really the guitar that sounds bad with it off if you could use these as headphones yeah you can stream Bluetooth audio to them and actually just bleed transport controls on there as well which and I think I carry startstop yes so Ill see if I can demonstrate them at off so I can talk say if were on Spotify you can pick the button in and it will play the track evils and for the track oh yeah but say if you want to go back so you you you missed a bit in the track and you want to rewind the track you can youve got like a rewind yeah we say Ill show you boots a leg so if I hold the button forward and tip them forward you can see it fall sports the track oh no way oh I see not yeah things just by tipping the headphones so what if you head bang with these two it came as if Im not watching you in a room just came like this so yeah you can rewind fastforward play and pause all from the headphones by dude but can you turn that off cuz like you really get into this track Ill be going it only works when you press testify no dick Ulis so then on top of that you can obviously use the editor if I just go back to it here yeah so theres actually a librarian so you can save all your own sounds in and then scroll through with the two buttons so if you can have up to six sound saved into the headphones and scroll through them and that can have any level ambience or youve already watts is it I dont know if hes actually i feel like can i get a projection out and unplug it just to be utterly clear again theres no line input on well you said this but how are you so that the the wireless receiver is builtin so dont fall this is just for pairing the transmitters right ok so yeah theres no sense that you can put a jack cable in here no theres no line out or anything its totally just a totally personal so but when you buy the headphones do you get the one you get the was if you had a anything really Oh guitar amplifier or a or a Kemper or whatever and you plugged this some form of line out and then into there would did although we havent tried it theres nothing to stop you feeling nerve at the end of your pedal blood sure should we just let me see unsavable because i just want to know yeah okay sure thats so thats exciting box thinking lets hack this I was even thinking again its but it was more lets say I had an alternative lets add a GT 1000 or something like that and I just wanted to apply plug it into the clean truck only Alcinous no theres always you cant turn the amp modeling off right but there is a flat mode for bass or acoustic so if you want to use it we actually tried it with a modular synth so we plugged it into the output of a synthesizer and then it did the same thing and you can turn around or if you want to do keyboards or a piano as well yeah it works totally presumably you always have that slight problem with this youll always need the wires in there no but then this switches itself off a bit doesnt stops moving yeah so youve always got you can okay I think you get around 60 minutes oh really yeah before Ive plugged my pedal board in Ive obviously used a cable to plug into my pedal board but I could conceivably buy a second wireless system if I wanted to and then right at the end where the cable would normally come out and go into the amp is the transmitter for the headphones so lets have everything off soft and the ambience off Ive set the answer flat so its just a queen out of string there with a bit reverb maybe here it can add a bit of reverb Music please hacked it if I can I can still then turn on the static mode turn down the ambience of the room oh man its literally the same as playing into an amp Im desperate to hear so so get a clean sound Ive got a clean sir are you ready Im ready Clem soul coming in holy bear delay from the pedalboard oh its not on bit delay Music and Ive seen the static mode so you can make your head yeah thats a tremendous amount of of being able to hack the system and make any more moves Ive got to say you know totally so Im gonna lose my link this is like my first reaction total honest everything first and foremost I think theyre beautifully made and they fit they do feel really comfy to wear and that thats always been my you know uncomfortable headphones are a terrible thing on themselves as in its flat mode for a backing track it just sounds like a great pair of headphones I I love as soon as you put it into any of the surrounding nodes I love the way that it gives you the sense that you are in the room Im not massively as you move your head around all Im really hearing is its changing the the accent on the volume to the left or the right ear it doesnt necessarily feel utterly natural you know you I can see whats sort of happening so Im not sure how much I would use that but but I would a million percent just leave this in the I love the idea of the fan being behind you and just playing I think thats the wick is a backing track thing for me is the real killer part of it because so often about youre playing on top of the track youre not playing with a track and it really allows you to sit in the mix I think youve described that perfectly mud because it made me feel like I was playing better because I felt like I was in a band yeah the experience of being in a band is well that delivers yeah and you know if you really want to turn around you in a solo wherever or get your laptop up and have a Wembley Stadium and play in front of a stadium you can really get that feel that youre playing in front of an audience is that just volume is it so yeah youve got guitar volume up and down for your patches and shares on the pads sort of the pads and then yeah the pads are also magnetic as well what do you mean just so if you oh I see the cleaning company you can just take them off oh yeah so no driver built into that as well so games are a big driver isnt it yes really designed for that balance of guitar playing and you know instrument and audio at the same time because if youre playing to an mp3 normally and you are just listening through a pair of audio headphones yeah and this is something totally different experience is there any way of getting the sound from these headphones out of the headphones only if you use something like we tested today now I see what on here but I think the thing is theyre great for you know playing at home or even though backstage or tour bus yeah you know rather than having you know you maybe just cant have it you know something like a honorary blasting out a little bit sound you need it to be polite you can totally hear a million applications yeah is that theyre really really good youve got to try them Pete do you want to have a little yeah can we play Peter Honora is now going to demonstrate for you the beautiful sounds are these boss headphones I hope you enjoyed them so youre gonna hear it totally clean all right so darling your amp sound and then Ill turn Ill turn it on okay all right Music right theres such a pleasing experience the son who said to watching someone else has reacted like this thick stick one a piece back in tracks I dig it big time so now you can move your head come on man so lets lets go for the lets go for the backing track then well go for the merry one so now its normal headphones here nope so now I put them in the band here so the bands behind you Laughter so I can turn up the ambience level can you can you is there a bit in the app where you can get the crowd to clap its weird man its giving flashbacks of being on stage big fans its what it is Music and then yeah move it to the studio for the ambience back a bit so yeah Im just there now oh this way Laughter Music theres over there yam sounds like its over there everything seems like its there yeah so what you can do that you love how when anyones got headphones on this time so you can actually reposition the amp they coded buttons on the side of the headphones you click and both in at the same time itll actually position the amp back behind you there you go so you can pick your front also when youre doing thats a crazy oh it behind you is wherever youre facing as you press it exactly yeah have we mentioned in this video you know how much you think theyre going to cost the RRP price is four to nine euros euros so probably under 400 pounds yo case or not ya know its cheap headphones are they but theyre actually as far as headphones go not expensive either no and I mean the fact that you can listen to audio theyre totally wireless and I mean there is no one that is doing anything similar and the fact that everythings built into the headphones is not the app thats doing it is to headphones that theyre doing all the processing hes gone hes loving noise Im gonna turn it off how much is katana air thats about 300 isnt it I think roughly RP price is about the same Wow so potentially because thats been massively popular all those thr amps have been massively popular so relatively speaking its the same though just a choice now as to whether or not you want to go show is it cool and the thing is you can fold it down you can put me to kick bag Im gonna go Im gonna put it back in this in this in on the stage or a maximum ambience you can share my lapel mic a more appropriate thing to do I think yeah oh please I hope these worked well for you guys when you were listening but I suspect the only way you can really do this is to try a pair yourself or you know take our word for it its pretty cool its the best best headphone experience Ive ever had 100 and I was I was totally  saying the first time I had someone walk me through them mmhmm I just got lost for like 20 minutes yeah flying  backing tracks going doesnt never put towns Im the only painter back I guess youre gonna need the app so to build to try them yeah you can actually use it without the app because everythings done in the headphone so there is some sounds already in the headphone so if you come into the store you can solicit the apps free apps free and yet you can tell us Android and iOS yep there will be an Android version as well youll get a pair thats great man Ive got to be honest with you I got all day long Sam sticky talk sounds are you taking these away with you yeah I need to throw them away okay well Im gonna buy a pair and just see cuz I think in the room for you for whatever you guys go was it sound like in the room and we try and concoct this idea of it some mics over here and up here and stuff it never wears Im thinking if thats just there and thats what thats what Im hearing is that my head head make sure you John Mayers face absolutely John Mayers lips when is and seriously man you need to team up with a virtual reality company as well because can you imagine the immersive experience have been why dont we get a pair youll say your get the chairs and captain guys just probably little audience out theres like a slightly longer print if somebody who works for a VR company is watching this a hundred percent do something that works they can you imagine being able to download backing tracks where you turn round and there is like your favorite band playing behind you and youre the guitar I think you know youd win I think know how you getting home thats just how you get lost in them well then we are there we go oh great that was a long video apologies but this is great there you go I know stock in time for Christmas sorry it was a bouncer like a round of applause thanks right yes so literally

102245649578", "video_id": "hROoQG_oPmw", "Closed Captions": " hey everyone whoever told me about these thank you very much because these are stupid cheap and from a respectable company Skullcandy now I decided not to be so cheap and purchased this one myself as always Ill be going over both pros and cons and if you want the most updated prices in real time Ill place my a fill links down in that video description click on that and youll see if theres any sale prices going on at the moment Im Jimmy with Jims review and Im here to help you guys make that purchase decision welcome everyone to another video look good and feel good  its smooth plastic construction like most other competitors and the touch button is layered with what feels to be a textured silicone covering over time people see if this part holds up now the Skullcandy sash is IP 5 rated meaning they are sweat water and dust resistant this can take up to low water jet sprays and with my testing putting some water all over these things the earphones are still fine 10 fees for looks comfort and stability I honestly thought these session would have been a bit more lower profile these are still good though as they dont stick out past my tears when looking straight down at you guys but looking closer there is a slight gap though from the side though it looks perfectly fine comfort wise these have been great for inear earphones they are also super light and airy feeling and I will admit I would have preferred a bit more stability since the only thing thats really keeping the sessions in the ear here is the ear tip themselves if you look closely you can see the bottom of these Skullcandy Seche is simply resting on the bottom of my ear but with that being said testing these in the gem testing these while running in of course the reasonable test right here these do these do stay in and I have had them fall out I do push the right ear but in from time to time to make a snug again once in a while but that could easily just be my ears as it the physical buttons Ill list all the actions on the screen for you guys the one thing that wont be a nuisance though for you at home is the double tap to increase or decrease volume doing a double press bumps it up once and if you need BOM to go up even higher you gotta tap it again you cant hold it down its just that intuitive now one feature of missing is audio passthrough I believe every pair of sport earphones needs to have this feature for situational awareness but you dont get that feature here where the microphones turn on and they pump and your environmental for again safety and awareness theres just times you just dont need that passive noise isolation you dont get that here now turn by time testing I can confirm you can take off the left earbud and still have music play its the same with your right side if you only want one earbud in the ear now since were talking about connections the Skullcandy set constant bluetooth 50 I was worried since the cheap down and the microUSB here for their charging case but Ill get into that a little bit later now bluetooth 50 is the latest and greatest with my testing Im able to reach up to 95 of my 1100 square foot apartment here having this signal go through several walls and thats really good testing this with video YouTube played perfectly fine Netflix nope very odd since this does have bluetooth 50 possibly theres a quarter second delay its minut but it is there if you do scrutinize now get him back to that charging case again microUSB is used instead of use PC which is somewhat of a letdown but again this is a definitely a bunch of pair of earphones hear better life is claimed to be only three hours of use per charge which is really love the average is usually between four to six hours of use at the moment the case can give you two full charges per skull Kandis website giving you a total of 10 hours this is on the low end Spokane you also discloses theres no fast charging with these but I did confirm about an hour in the case here does bring the earphones from dead to a full battery alright lets get into the audio performance heres the microphone test and before doing so please be sure to visit here and follow my personal Instagram and Twitter those handles are on your screen follow my account there I place the links in the video description as well for your convenience all right folks here we go if you want to use this one here but definitely left that for you but it was jar walking along this road here and John is here these parts go by and seeing if if these were found suppresses the background and isolate my voice for those clear phone calls well see folks let me know down in the comment section below how this sounds hopefully it sounds good to you guys and well go back to the studio alright okay alright folks welcome back here lets get into the audio performance these things are crazy loud and theres no exaggeration for casual listening at 20 to 25 is good enough here with my phone at 30 to 35 volume its equal to most of my other earphones I listen to at 70 to 75 vine when I watch Jim out the second thing youll notice right off the bat here it doesnt matter if youre an audiophile or not these are freakin Basie as hell for those who are familiar with skull candy crushers that comes with a huge amount of resonance and deep bassy notes the sashes are very similar but the basic experience on these isnt as clean though the quality is very subjective here this is definitely I would say fall into either you love the category or you basically hate it if you like bass more so than refined audio where it has a less space here these might surely float your boat but those who prefer a bit more finesse the bass can be very overpowering somewhat causing the lower end of vocals to be slightly suppressed here and listening to these for a long period of time during my testing here does cause slight listening fatigue due to all that bass experience now the upper midrange stood out enough for the upper end of vocals to be identified and appreciated the high frequencies themselves sounds to have some rolloff here or maybe that bass is just too overpowering that you dont really experience that crisp and reasonably sharp snare drum and cymbal Crashs at the very top now with more complex songs the audio identification does become slightly jumbled here it was my illustration of my fingers hearing say an instrument in the foreground and then another slightly off to the side and then here these singer performance well it can get a bit mixed now as you can see I try to be very fair and theres always a product that fits someones needs some like domestic while some like foreign vehicles some dudes like fix some dudes know who knows but these indeed this wasnt for me these were hyper niche for the bass heads out there in the end if you love bass  refinement these are worth a consideration for the price but keep in mind I think most will find these a little too overpowering but again thats your call folks comment down below in the comment section here if you already purchased these let me know what you guys think if you guys have returned them who knows let us know so you can help others on this channel folks follow me on social media Jimmy local official NJ

also LED lighting effects and its noise cancellation microphone is detachable the sound quality of the cloud flight is very good given its price you will be genuinely surprised at the level of punch thats delivered a headset at this price point is never going to rival a pair of luxury headphones like the SteelSeries arctas pro but the flight isnt as far off as youd imagine it provides rich sound quality with crystalclear low mid and high tones the enhanced bass reproduction gives a gaming experience unique to the cloud flight headset it features a 50 millimeter driver with neodymium magnets

not wake up those around you when a huge stand out of the cloud flight is its long battery life while most competitors lasts up to 15 hours on average this headset lasts up to an incredible thirty hours of gameplay so long gaming sessions will not be a problem the HyperX cloud flight may not be the newest or a featurerich wireless gaming headset but it is a great bang for the buck it offers a good mix of high durability good battery life decent sound quality and remains nicely affordable the cloud flight offers quality above its price point and itll be a trusty companion for a long time up next is the Logitech G 533 our pick for the best budget wireless gaming headset if you are on a budget and are looking for a wireless headset that will increase your gaming mobility yet still remain both attractive and affordable then the Logitech G 533 may be the one for you coming in at just under 70 this is one of the best budget wireless gaming headsets around the Logitech G 533 does an excellent job in striking the right balance between comfort features and performance the jet black matte plastic headband has a nice stealthy appearance and theres an ample layer of padding on the underside of the ear cups youll appreciate that rather than using PU leather the g5 33 is covered by a durable soft mesh cloth material that helps to reduce heat and sweat both ear cups are well sized and have a square opening to fit over your ears at 350 grams its lightweight and comfortable to wear even for long gaming sessions the wireless range works up to 15 meters and the battery lasts up to 15 hours with the included micro USB cable charging is quick and setup is easy straight out of the box simply connect the USB dongle to a free port on your PC and you are up and ready for action you can enable the DTS for 71 virtual surround sound through the Logitech software which adds an immersive level to your gaming however for music listening it does a respectable job but the base is a little underpowered the microphone does a pretty good job of vocal recording and is reasonably clear however the volume of the recordings could be better but a voice chat is all youre after then youll have no complaints overall the Logitech G 533 is a versatile allrounder that performs well sounds good in games is comfortable to wear and provides plenty of battery life and decent Wireless range you cant expect the g5 33 to sound like the cinema but it surely outperforms its entrylevel price point next we have the SteelSeries arcgis 9x our pick for the best wireless gaming headset for xbox one not all gaming headsets perform the same when it comes to working with the Xbox one so if Xbox is your game system then the SteelSeries arcgis 9x is the headset for you at under 200 the arctic 9x is specially engineered to work wirelessly with the Xbox console and it provides a nearperfect connection combined with a rich audio experience and impressive battery life the arctas 9x boasts immersive sonic spatial audio which essentially means the audio performance is engineered to detect all of the noises happening around you regardless of how subtle or abrasive they might be the ArcGIS 9x is versatile and can be used both wirelessly and wired although a cable isnt supplied in the box it wirelessly connects to your Xbox one just like a controller and its a breeze to set up one of the main features of the SteelSeries arcgis 9x is its dual connectivity options you can connect to a PC or console and also to another Bluetooth device simultaneously by utilizing the Xbox wireless connectivity and Bluetooth together at the same time for example you can listen to music off of your phone while at the same time hear your ingame audio the added convenience to be able to have dual connectivity is awesome because you cant get that with most other headsets the mic is clear comes with decent noise canceling and best of all is retractable for when youre not using it while you can never completely remove the mic its it enough for you to use this headset as an everyday pair of cans connecting to phones and tablets via the Bluetooth connection thats a real bonus when compared to the similarly priced a 50 the SteelSeries arcgis 9 x is an awesome headset for Xbox one and wirelessly connects with the simplicity of a controller its a great package for anyone serious about sound and wanting to get the most out of their Xbox games if you play games primarily on the Xbox one the arc dis 9x is the top choice however if youre looking for a headset for PC games then the SteelSeries arcgis pro coming up next might be a better choice for you if youre interested in updated pricing on any of the items mentioned in this video be sure to check out the links below prices update on these products almost daily with sales and general price drops so if you want to find the most updated information check the description if you find this video helpful please help out the

are willing to invest a little bit more for a premium topoftheline wireless gaming headset the SteelSeries arcgis pro looks stylish is comfortable to wear and delivers mind blowing sound worthy of audiophile worship this wireless headset is truly a gamers dream and at under 330 dollars an investment in these babies is well worth it the SteelSeries arcgis pro is minimalist and has no fluff in its classy matte and ergonomic design like the a 50 youll love that the headband and magnetic ear cup covers can be replaced so you can personalize your prose and make them truly yours whats more changing the batteries wont slow you down theres a magnetic battery cover on the right side that lets you easily swap out Power Cells with one hand while keeping your other hand on the keyboard or controller the USB wireless transmitter features a clear OLED screen making it easy to navigate the UI plus the transmitter box also acts as a charger for your spare headset battery between the 10 hours of playtime youll get from each battery and the fact that they take less than an hour to fully recharge you can basically keep playing with this gaming headset forever thanks to its 40000 Hertz capable high fidelity speaker drivers you will be blown away by the amazing sound quality you get from this headset it is by far one of the best sounding wireless gaming headsets around arguably even better than many wired headsets although the SteelSeries arcgis pro is on the high end of the price spectrum and will set you back a pretty penny they are well worth the investment it does a bangup job delivering on all fronts and is by far one of the best sounding gaming headsets money can buy you will not be sorry finally we have the Astro a50 our choice for a great overall wireless gaming headset at just under 300 the Astro a 50 is a great choice if you are looking for a well crafted versatile and great sounding wireless headset that will deliver an immersive gaming surround sound experience not only will you love the Astro a 50s well weighted feel but youll also love that this wireless gaming headset comes with a USB base station you get up to 15 hours of gameplay and the best part of all the extremely convenient magnetic docking design makes it very easy to keep your headset recharged you simply drop ba 50 into the base station when not in use and it will always be ready to go one perk in the design is that the headpiece can be swapped out along with the ear cups to tweak the styling to your choosing the microphone is very flexible and you can lock it in mute when it is pointing straight up so if you get interrupted during ingame chat you can instantly flip the mic to mute your conversation talk without having your private conversation accidentally broadcasted over the mic then flip it right back to continue your ingame chat very quick and seamless but on the downside you cant completely remove the microphone so it may be a bit annoying if you are using the headset to watch TV and also not very practical if you want to use this headset for music while on the go in terms of raw audio quality the a 50 is topnotch and the 40 millimeter drivers do a fantastic job of delivering even the smallest of sounds by enabling the Dolby headphone technology the surround sound wraps the game around your ears and immediately immerses you in the action like hearing the sound of footsteps creeping up behind you or the power of an explosive blast next to you the wireless range is about 30 feet and the signal is very good you wont lose connection even when you are in the next room although the Astro 850 headset is one of the pricier ones on our list it is very well rounded on all fronts for any gamer who wants a powerful versatile wireless gaming headset as well as a good headset for stereo surround sound in your living room a 50 delivers and is worth looking at alright guys thats all for now if you enjoyed this video please go ahead and leave

canceling models typically offer the most comprehensive set of features the best options combine stellar audio with powerful active noise cancellation or anc mix those elements with other handy tools to create as complete a package as possible of course some companies do this better than others after extensive testing and indepth reviews weve compiled a list of the best wireless headphones you can buy right now Music top overall pick the sony wh1000x m3 since their debut in 2018 sonys m3 have been our number one choice for noisecanceling headphones the companys 1000x line of overear models was already good but the third generation firmly planted sony ahead of bose the 1000x m3 is more comfortable than its predecessor thanks to soft ear pads a cushioned headband and reduced weight however the most notable upgrades are on the inside these headphones mark the debut of sonys powerful qn1 noise canceling processor the chip not only blocks out more external sound than the 1000xm2 but also relieves the dac of the anc duties that gives both components more room to work more effectively for that reason sony can offer 32bit audio and ldap compatibility for highres over bluetooth our only real gripe is with the frustrating touch controls but the core audio features remain the best your money can buy this model has some age on it at this point and should be due for an upgrade soon but until then the wh 1000x m3 remains number one in a close second we have the bose 700 bose hasnt been our top pick for a while but that doesnt mean the company isnt still making good audio gear last year it launched the bose 700 a new take on its noise cancelling headphones that has less of that data on a business trip vibe the company was clear that these arent replacing the popular quiet comfort line but rather serve as an alternative bose nailed the anc and touch controls on the 700 however the company didnt include custom eq options or sound presets inside of its app because the treble can be harsh at times this was a little disappointing the 700 is 50 more than the 1000xm3 which is another reason bose wasnt able to retake the top spot in our rankings if youre looking to save some coin our best budget pick is the audio technica ath m50x bt audio technicas m50 headphones are a popular choice among djs and producers for their accurate response and comfy fit the company debuted a wireless version in 2018 that offers the same design without the need for a cord theres no anc here but there is sublime audio quality at headphones have great clarity and warmth to the tone which makes them a solid choice for a range of genres in fact these are actually my favorite headphones on this list in terms of audio quality despite the lack of active noise cancellation you still get a host of handy features like onboard controls and 40hour battery life the m50x bt also has the 90degree swiveling ear cups from its predecessors which allow the headphones to lay flat and fold in on themselves for storage plus these are very affordable at least for quality headphones at 180 if you dont find yourself in noisy spots often these are certainly worth a look if onear headphones are more your style our top choice is the beat solo pro onair headphones arent for everyone if you have a huge head almost every pair will feel like a vice of course if your headphones have a and c you need that pressure to create a good seal while the solo pro may not be the ideal headphones for everyone theyre still feature packed and sound good the solo pro houses the same chip that powers apples air pods which means you get quick pairing and handsfree access to siri the audio tuning is balanced without the overbearing bass beats is known for im convinced these are the best sounding beats headphones to date anc works well transparency mode is handy and the onboard controls are simple and reliable refined design touches also make these a solid upgrade over the previous solo model and a worthy option for fans of the onair style if youre not sure if any of these are right for you there are a few more alternatives sennheisers momentum 3 wireless for example is much more refined looking than the competition thanks to a blend of leather and metal these latest members of the momentum family have active noise cancellation eq customization and excellent sound quality i had two main gripes with these headphones though first the battery life is only 17 hours a little over half of what sony offers on the 1000xm3 second the builtin motion sensors for automatic pausing are pretty sensitive and occasionally picked up subtle movements at strange times the noise cancellation isnt as powerful as what sony and bose offer but itll do the job in most environments the mw3 was a tough sell at its original 39995 price but now that its going for around 50 less its at least slightly more compelling last but not least the sony whch710n if you want capable noise cancellation that wont break the bank sonys wh ch710 is a solid bit the recently announced headphones cost much less than a flagship model although you will sacrifice a few things the biggest place these fall short is overall sound quality theres decent range and good clarity but they lack deep punchy bass that would help create a fuller sound for casual listeners who want a decent set of headphones that still have a and c these will likely offer enough in the sonic department the wh ch710n has enough sound blocking power to minimize distractions thanks to sonys dual noise sensor technology these headphones pick up a lot of that unwanted noise and automatically select the best cancellation for your environment theres also an ambient sound option should you need to keep tabs on whats going on around you with 35 hours of battery life quick charging and handy onboard controls to round out the features list the wh ch710n offers a glimpse of flagship luxury for around 150 less than many of those options there

reviewing the JBL toon 500 bt bluetooth headphones these run about fifty dollars retail price I got them off of Walmart you can get them from JBLs website Amazon anywhere like that these are bluetooth headphones with handsfree calls and 16 hours of battery life so for 16 hours of battery life and only 50 dollars were looking at a budget pair of bluetooth headphones and I gotta tell you guys for this price range these are very very good and as you can see here one of the main features here is the pure bass 0 cables JBL markets this to have their JBL pure bass sound which is like i guess their signature sound that they put in their professional grade speakers so you also have Siri and Google now its got a handsfree microphone for calls multipoint connection which basically if youre if the Bluetooth headphones are connected to two different devices say youre listening to music on your computer through the headphones and you get a phone call and your phone is connected to the headphones as well then itll automatically switch over to your phone so you can answer the call on your headphones so thats a cool little feature Im not sure if I would ever use it that much but in case you guys do that kind of stuff its a good feature to have so these are also lightweight and have a foldable foldable design which Ill show you guys here just in a second and the last feature we have here on the box is five minutes of charging equals an hour of music play time so its got the rapid charge which is really good thats a pretty good comparing to the more expensive headphones on the market and on the bottom here is just some little specifications the frequency response range is 20 Hertz to 20000 Hertz and then its a thirty two millimeter drivers and for some reason it says 35 millimeter right there for like the auxiliary input but it actually doesnt have an auxilary input its all bluetooth so go ahead and open up this box its a really good presentation I do like it especially being a budget pair of headphones opening up the box its pretty plain and simple you got this background picture nothing other than your manuals and then I here in this plastic you get a little guard to keep them from falling out a micro USB charger so this is one of the minor complaints I have it just seems like most brands nowadays have been moving over to USB typec and this one has not yet even though this is a fairly new product but thats okay Im sure a lot of us still have a bunch of these they come with everything speakers all those types of things so and it comes with its own so if you guys dont have one there it is it is nice that it has that fast charging feature though so heres that phones themselves as you can see they are collapsible so you can either collapse them in like this or you can do it to be like that so first of all lets go over the build quality and then Ill talk about the sound quality so for the build quality we have a plastic finish all around the entire things plastic it does feel kind of cheap Im gonna be honest with you guys it is a pretty cheap quality wise but I mean were talking about budget headphones 50 if you guys like take care of your things you shouldnt have a problem like me I havent had a problem with the built quality on these but if you guys tend to break things off in you might have a little bit of trouble with these I do like the design the shininess on the JBL and that circle around it kind of just makes them look a bit more classy and sporty when youre wearing them also the earcup padding on here is pretty cheap as well I dont see it being a problem for me really maybe in the long run something could happen to them but I mean they twist around its kind of just like cheaper its very thin feeling definitely nothing like leather as well as this pad here on the top its the same material you can see how it wrinkles when I put pressure on it but like I said if you guys take care of your things it shouldnt be a problem and then you got your right and left ear cup indicators right there button layout you got plus and minus for volume and playing pause in the middle you can also answer calls and if you double press this middle button it will either activate Siri or Google now if you press and hold the plus button it will skip tracks and if you press and hold the minus button itll skip back then you have your power button you press and hold for a couple seconds to turn on and then same with turning them off as soon as you turn it on I will go into pairing mode and then you can pair it with your smartphone then press and hold to turn them back off and theres your microphone on the right side here you have your charging port on top so it does get covered up when youre wearing them which could be a good thing or a bad thing its a little harder to get at but since it swivels so much it shouldnt be a problem you also get the adjustable headband which is plastic on the inside same type of plastic on both sides so build quality is not the best but lets talk about sound quality now overall the sound quality I think is good for the average consumer I think there are really no complaints one problem I did have with was just how their main presentation on the box is pure bass and so that kind of just gives you the presumption of a lot of bass in these headphones which its really not a ton of bass I personally like the amount of bass but if you want to really be expecting a lot of bass out of these youre not going to be getting that like maybe the Skullcandy crushers it definitely does dont get me wrong it has really good bass its just not as present as maybe some of you guys would like the bass is not overpowering in any way but it definitely has a good frequency it has deep rich bass that sounds good and I think that is what JBL is talking about in the pure bass marketing that they are showing on the box for the mids the mids are very present and the highs are clear so youre not really going to have a problem with those the different frequencies are well separated its not like all mush together and muggy obviously these are not the most clear sounding but for what they are for 50 dollars they are great I have no complaints if you guys are looking for something really clear like Bose thats not gonna youre just not going to find that in 50 all our headphones but I think for 50 dollars at this price point its a really really good sounding headset the handsfree call quality is also pretty well I havent really done extensive testing on it but I have taken a few calls on here and I had no issue hearing the person and the person had no issue hearing me so the microphone here is its placed on the right side to where its kind of facing outwards more towards your face so no problem with that real quick guys I just wanted to mention that I actually started my own vlog Channel Nathan winter vlogs on YouTube I do a lot of adventuring stuff I went to Utah backpacking on a backpacking trip and different things like that so if you guys are into that kind of stuff it would be awesome if you would go check out my channel I really would appreciate the support sorry for them option guys will go ahead and get back to the review theyre very lightweight so these are really good I wear them to the gym Ive worn um about three times to the gym so these are pretty fairly new but if you guys are looking for a pair of headphones wireless headphones to wear at the gym these would be great honestly theyre lightweight theyre not too expensive so if something happens you know you drop a weight on them or something its not going to be the end of the world they definitely do sound great for the gym especially and like I said being lightweight when youre running and stuff they dont kind of they dont flop around they have a good snug fit on your head long time periods of wearing these are not much of a problem for me I never really experienced any pain or anything but it kind of just depends on the person how sensitive you are how your head fits with the them but I had no complaints with the padding or anything like that so overall I think these are great headphones for the price point for a budget bluetooth headphones these might even be the best ones you can pick up I havent really had a ton of these before at this price but I know for a fact Id rather spend 50 on these than 300 on beats if you dont want to spend a lot of money on really high quality headphones you just want some to take traveling with you throw in your bag do things like going to the gym these would be perfect for that thats going to conclude it for this video I hope you guys enjoyed it and if you did make sure to give this video a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel for more videos

otherwise you wont get the man Applause there you go quite smart pair of headphones so lets take a closer look at these headphones some in extendable arms Music theyve got controllers on the side of the other black bones youve got onoff button just press it in for two seconds and then release it and it switches it on and then youve got volume controls up and down you got pause and stop button and the pauses stop button also controls the Bluetooth phone so you can make and receive Bluetooth phone calls as is that theres a microphone inside here and the actual phones as well to fold flats like that so its good for packing if youre traveling somewhere hundred annasan quality of these headphones is very good especially for the price so I was quite impressed obviously youre not going to get the bestinclass sound from a top range of Bluetooth wireless headphones but for the price and these were about thirty five pound hes hes good good quality so lets see how they feel on my on my ears its a nice snug fit and also if it does actually can slice a lot of background noise because its a snug fit why dont my only criticism means though that they are little bit on the firm side on my ears but you do get used to that and the other benefits of having on ear headphones is I find that my ears dont get as warm as when Im wearing over the ear headphones so its really good and theyre lightweight as well and you got a bit of freedom to move around dance to your music and and the range easily is really good Ive managed to get a range of about just up to five meters so I can go anywhere in my house I can make a drink and I can still listen to the music or I can listen to comity on the TV and not miss anything while Im away from the TV so its really useful and it comes with a handy easytofollow instruction manual its a bit basic but it does give you enough information on how to use these headphones now let me show you how to pay these headphones with your smart phone TV or laptop first Ill show you how to pair them to your smart phone make sure that bluetooth is set to on on your smart phone before you press the onoff button on your headphones otherwise you may have problems connecting your device hold the onoff button down for two seconds and your headphones will start connecting to your smart phone indicated by the flashing blue LED so now we can see that our headphones are connected to our smartphone and theres also an icon of a pair of headphones on the top right hand side of our phone so now any music that we play from our smartphone will come through our headphones now lets pay the headphones with a smart TV first switch your headphones on and then go to menu on your Smart TV and select sound and then find your Bluetooth sound settings Im using a Samsung TV so my settings might be different to yours when you found your Bluetooth audio settings then you just need to click OK to connect your headphones to your TV and mines disconnected so now I can play my TV sound through my headphones now lets pay your headphones with your laptop first turn on your headphones then go to settings and devices switch bluetooth are and then click to add your Bluetooth device and there it is and its connected so now you can play music from your laptop through your headphones here is a quick troubleshooting guide to address the most common issue which is connecting the headphones to your preferred device quite often the reason for this is because your headphones are already paired to a different device and you need to disconnect and pair your headphones from that device first before you can connect it to a new one well thanks for watching and if you did like my video please thumbs up and if you got any comments as well or any questions

around about that but he was my internet connection it was just not fast enough I so I just cant stream sorry guys just want to give you guys an update about that anyways shoutout to Diego if youre watching but anyways just wanted to give you an update due to popular request here here are the Razer hammerhead truly wireless earphones that I personally purchased razors klemming some uptodate specs with an emphasis on low latency theyre super small theyre lightweight and they remind me of the Apple earpods a bit what the hell as always being transparent I personally paid for these at their retail price for free to click on my affiliate links down in that video description below for the most updated prices in real time you never know where these things might go on sale and I do make a small Commission if you purchase something from those links Im Jimmy with Jims review room and Im here to help you guys make that purchase decision welcome everyone to another review Music all right let me start off this review by giving you guys a bro tip pro tip here the first thing youll notice theyre not in ear earphones you might like that as most other truly wireless earphones have ear tips going into the ear canal and I know for some that might be uncomfortable the hammerhead sits more so on the outside and they are very comfortable in this case there are some downsides to which Ill mention later in this review but they stay in really well theres tons of stability or peace of mind here especially when youre using the silicone cover they provide in the box now testing these for running and other vigorous movements here they stay in ridiculously well now for those intending and using these for I dont know those hot and sweaty yoga sessions maybe running in the rain or so their IP 4 rated meeting they are able to take on a splash of water with my testing spring water all over these things on a video as you can see here the hammerheads arent holding up perfectly fine now getting a closer look functions and features include a single tap to pause and play you do have to hold it actually for a brief second or so instead of an instant tap which was a bit funky but you do build up muscle memory after a day or two theres double tap to skip triple tap to go back and last is three taps but holding that last one for about two seconds to activate game mode the touch is responsive but the whole thing was just a little bit different for me here though they havent had truly wireless earphones features Bluetooth 50 testing this for distance on both my Android pixel 4 XL and iPhone 10 Im only achieving 60 to 70 of my 1100 square foot apartment which is on the lower end of other truly wireless earphones that I have to test it here now with other competitors Im usually achieving about 90 as for video and razer promotes these are to be low latency im normal not game mode i do notice theres an ever so slight delay im very minutely lato ad for bluetooth 50 but when i do switch it to game mode i do notice that ever so slight delay of being gone now one a good amount of newer truly growlers earphones dont have delays these days and second why cant the hammerheads have low latency or no delay right out the box a little bit funky there as well not implying anything but just essentially why but when you do activate game mode I can on both devices and on both or all three here YouTube Netflix and twitch also test this on the Call of Duty mobile game app and other just random games the delay is gone though and I feel it does live up to that low latency claim now one hurdle I found out you dont have multi parent meaning I cant pair the hammerheads to two devices at the same time and then whichever device I click play on the connection basically jumps over and then plays that source instead I have to disconnect from the first device before I can pair this to a second device or just a heads up on them so folks lets jump into power here razor is claiming four hours per use with twelve additional hours if you utilize their charging case now four hours is at the low end even for budget truly wireless earphones these days if you dont intend on having long listening sessions you might be fine to be fair with my testing playing is that 50 BAM with the same playlist that I use on all of my devices I achieved four hours and 50 minutes now as for that charging case though I do like how slim this thing is here but I do wish the case had a little bit more texture it is a little bit slippery at times especially when you try to prop open this lid the lid itself doesnt have much of a locking mechanism or snapping mechanism to keep that lid open as you can see kind of flops back by itself but other that the case does offer us PC which is a plus and the charge time claims where the earbuds are inside the case it takes an hour and a half from dead to full now before we get into the audio test some things I wanted to point out here these do sound liek a good bit at moderate to large volumes they hammerhead true Wireless have barely any passive noise isolation remember these set more so on the outside of the ear canal some of you might like that since you have situational awareness at all times so you can essentially hear your surroundings for me this is just personal preference here because theyre not in ear theyre not passive noise isolating I just basically lose my music and movie immersion experience as the audio is not as direct in my ear second I prefer earphones and even headphones with some sort of audio passthrough where you have passive noise isolation from the world if you want and then you can turn on your microphones and the audio in your environment is then pumped in again thats all youll pass through you basically have options now with these just make sure you know what youre getting you might be okay with that it is a matter of your priorities I guess you can say and honestly the air pods sold like crazy so Im sure theres a market out there for non passive non inear earphones again to be fair so folks lets get into the microphone test here let me give you guys a quick sample hopefully they sound great here but before doing so please be sure to follow me on my social media handles at Jimi loom official or Jhelum official on both Instagram and Twitter respectively on your screen also Ill place it down in that video description also you guys see my efforts in each one of these videos trying to help you guys make that purchase decision smash that like button its always appreciated here anyways here we go all right folks testing out the microphones on the razor truly wireless earphones so with this tester Im trying to see if this is isolating my booth with what is going on in the background hopefully also pushing my voice forward so its clear I mean recipient and once I do that yeah when testing this to a phone call it does play through both earphones and if I were to take one of them out is phone call will still continue uh I notice also a very light breeze going on comment down below guys let me know what you guys think and looking back theres studio all right lets go in first all right testing the microphones on the WUF 1093 slight breeze going on here and of course having these cars whiz by see if it does pick up those noises and see if these microphones actually I should apply postsocialist sometimes around me here as well so let me know in the comments below where you guys think Im good all right let me get back for this video alright folks lets talk about the audio performance first up these do get quite loud theres no question about that at 50 Im usually jamming out yet still at a somewhat of a safe level if Im listening just to have something in the background Im usually at 30 volume now getting into bass these are punchy earphones bass is fast its direct and within the app you can activate the bass boost to give these a little bit more depth but want to activate bass boost it sounds to lower the midrange and it makes the vocal work sound a bit recessed overall its decent punchy bass thats effective for mass market I believe that the base audio sound signature there the midrange though not as default setting within the app is the best not the midrange is president clear with singers voices being very much identifiable thats a huge plus there the fact that these arent in ear earphones does make you lose somewhat of that performance as when you actually press this gently into your ears you can hear the hammerheads gets a bit deeper and you can say the music has a bit more depth that is but of course testing these without holding them into my head like so you do lose some of those qualities you do get some audio separation more would definitely have been ideal to help increase resolution interpretation and again that feeling of depth and your music when Im gaming when I test this on my mobile apps here they sound just really generic kind of shocking to me as a razor are known for the headset and obviously for gaming as well the high frequencies do offer a nice snap though without being screeching on the top them especially for games where bullets are flying or being shot its not piercing your ears now wearing these while testing Ive never had any kind of listening fatigue and they are good for longterm listening now in general theyre not bad but weve heard better sounding earphones at the 100 price range with some of the budget truly ROVs earphones that I reviewed in the past these in general or loud theyre not bad at all but its lacking in that audio department also the gaming mode and non gaming mode with that low latency when activated perform similar to other good truly wireless earphones so there wasnt really anything special there low battery life and the funky case here I just really did enjoy this you guys kind of get the gist from me it was just adding up I was hoping Razer would have offered something amazing I was rooting for them I was excited but in the end man these things are again I guess to sum it up generic like I said just helping you guys make that purchase decision

the rest the category but the logitech g pro x wireless is exactly what you would expect for the g pro x wireless to be the pro line is really all about the core functionality of this being a solid gaming headset uh in esports and at your home i feel like logitech really pioneered the whole idea behind wireless gaming peripherals being just as good as their wired counterparts removing the whole stigma around latency around battery life around reliability in the heat of the moment and the g pro x wireless is a really good contender on the market but basically all my complaints of the wired version the g pro x still carry over to the wireless version unfortunately so in this video lets see exactly what is different talk about the sound quality the microphone quality and its relation to other wireless gaming headsets that are still worth it in 2020 lets review react to this say hello to proper airflow with be quiet purebase 500dx a compact mid tower with a mesh front panel and three 140 millimeter pure wings two fans that are silent and capable enjoy tasteful argb illumination a typec port and an easy case to work in check it out below all right so lets begin with some bad news uh the price point 199 dollars thats a 70 premium versus the g pro x the wired version or you can even spend less 99 for the standard g pro that is exactly the same headset but without the blue voice functionality and by the way i dont want to spoil anything but blue voice is just as bad as it is here as it was on the wired version as for accessories all the basics are covered we have the usbc cable for charging a replacement set of velour ear pads theres a carry pouch and the usb dongle that you can store inside the ear cup just rotate it and it will not fall out in terms of design nothing has changed the headset being wireless though has increased in weight slightly versus the original g pro x and the ear cup uh thickness has also increased not the actual cushions but the ear cup itself because thats where you can house the additional components and the battery it is one of the heaviest wireless pairs i have in my collection but you dont really feel that which is a good thing they kind of disappear on your head after a while the leather headband is fantastic feels really premium i do like the pro x over here as well and the stitching on the sides the exposed coiled cable on top of each ear cup looks fantastic and in my experience with the g pro x which is what ive been using for the last like six to eight months as my primer gaming headset ive never noticed this to be an issue and it shouldnt be an issue here either overall the build quality feels okay but the swivel on my wireless version is slightly more loose than what i have on my wired version and my only nitpick about like the design um is the chrome accented centerpieces over here that pick up all types of material and gunk that accumulates in the grooves and also this matte black material that is super easy to scratch the size extensions are necessary here and i wish that we had a little bit more just because im starting to appreciate wireless gaming audio more and more now now that i have a virtual reality headset so heres my rift test ill be doing this comfort test for all wireless gaming headsets in the future lets see how the g pro x wireless handles this uh situation its not bad the headset is very comfortable the clamping force is not too tight i just wish the ear cushions were slightly thicker so that it would create a better seal otherwise theres a bit of spacing that is created comfort wise outside of vr i find these fantastic even with glasses theres no excessive clamping force ive worn these six hours yesterday and took taking them off theres no ringing ears theres no pressure accumulation anywhere the only two things to keep in mind is that there isnt much padding on the interior so if your ears are larger or like more sticking out and if they do make contact with that internal wall it might not be so comfortable and of course heat accumulation because of the leather ear pads which is why i appreciate the included velour pads which are fantastic for the heat of the summer which is now now given this is a wireless pair all the controls are located on the left side so we have our power switch with the red and blue indicators we have a very smooth volume wheel above that is a mic mute then theres the typec below the power button and an led indicator the microphone of course is removable but unfortunately theres no easy way to tell which way the microphone capsule should face your mouth i had to remove the memory foam in order to realize which way is the correct way i am not a fan of this volume wheel just like i was not a fan of it on the g915 keyboards for three reasons theres a bit of resistance on it but no ductility whatsoever theres always a bit of a delay between when you adjust the volume on the headset versus when you see the volume bar in windows and number three it is difficult to have precise volume adjustment because of the other two points so you always end up lowering or adding more volume than intended battery life is rated at 20 hours which i think is conservative because in six hours i dropped 20 so if you do the interpolation i should have about 30 hours of runtime the one annoying thing about this wireless player and really all wireless gaming headsets is that if you shut down the system and you power it back on you have to manually turn the headset off and back on again for it to be recognized by the dongle i would recommend having dongle in your site because if the green led is flashing it means this thing is disconnected and if the green is solid it means the headset is connected so now lets talk about sound quality and i gotta say ive always enjoyed logitech wireless audio and this guy is no exception to me they sound almost identical versus the wired g pro x which has natural clean balanced sound and that carries over to the pro x wireless they sound so much fuller and cleaner versus the corsair hs70 that kind of almost sounds hollow they have much better midrange definition and overall resolution versus the cloud flight but i still feel like the gsp 370 from sennheiser is a better sounding pair just the low end is deeper and richer and if you try to add some bass in the equalizer settings and the ghub suite it doesnt really work here it kind of falls apart i prefer the default neutral state because otherwise it sounds muddy when any bass is added in here the high notes a beautiful toe really smooth clean theres no hiss in the background even when the headset is at zero volume and i really feel like theyve tuned the drivers and the wireless connection to sound as close as possible to the wired version and thats a major positive this headset has excellent passive noise isolation because of the ear cushions really muting out everything thats in your environment and that really helps to pinpoint details in your gaming environment about audio cues and directional awareness you dont need surround sound you dont need virtual 71 all that stuff stereo imaging on here is fantastic by default and i really dont know what logitech has done here in terms of surround sound which was fantastic on the g933 and the 900 series of headsets but here it is its just absolutely not worth it not only does it create a really bad soundstage environment but the bass is incredibly muddy so you lose out a ton of detail on the low end and there is absolutely no advantage in terms of directional awareness when stereo mode is already so good so their new cinematic surround sound to my ears sounds horrible it really pains me to say that honestly because i loved it on the 900 series of headsets but i dont know what happened if i was to place this headset in terms of audio quality versus everything else that ive heard this would be close second right behind the gsp 370 in terms of quality much better than the cloud flight much better than the virtual also much better than the hs70 but its also a lot more expensive i think the expensive part really comes not from the wireless nature but from the the little blue voice tax as i call it and that is because i feel like the microphone capsule itself as you will hear is just not capable of receiving so many effects of noise gate and compression for it to sound good because by default it doesnt sound very good so applying a bunch of effects on top of that makes it sound worse lets uh lets take a listen so what youre hearing now is that recorded by the pro x wireless without blue voice enabled and by default like if you apply any effects onto this its not going to fix a poor microphone its not clear its highly compressed and doesnt sound natural and its not exactly what blue is known for right one of my favorite microphones is actually from blue the blue amber which has beautiful warm tones i mean putting blue voice on this package is an embarrassment really but now lets enable blue voice so it can sound worse what youre hearing now is that with the broadcaster one preset and it does add a little bit more bass a lot more compression some noise gate so i am louder but the microphone still is quite poor this is the g2 kenny s preset i dont know how its in the pro slash broadcaster category because it sounds nothing like it should this is a fun one fm station this is probably what i would use to chat with the boys this is a tsm myth and i do appreciate it we have a lot of flexibility in the software i disabled blue voice just so we can have this conversation without anything applied on the microphone i like i appreciate the idea behind blue voice and being able to tweak each single eq setting and come up with your own preset but it doesnt fix a microphone that is already poor just for reference heres the wired pro x headset plugged into the usb dongle with blue voice disabled one tip is that you have to lower the gain over here to 50 around 50 especially for my voice because otherwise we are clipping and this microphone does sound better than the wireless one thats understandable and actually does sound much better when we enable blue voice as well as long as your gain is controlled so if your gain is too high it will sound terrible if you gain is slightly lower it will definitely compensate adding more bass and it will remove a lot of the distortion that might happen when the microphone is too sensitive right now i have the broadcaster one preset enabled and as long as my sensitivity is under control it does improve the overall vocal quality adding more bass more fullness and more compression to the voice so the wired microphone without and with blue voice does sound better than the wireless now to be fair i feel like all wireless headsets have subpar microphone quality this one is no exception the gsp 370 by sennheiser i mean theres a lot more to be desired in terms of depth resolution of your voice and clarity too it just feels so unnatural and compressed and just to give you another reference point this is the cloud flight also wireless headset with a wireless microphone but with much worse microphone quality versus the g pro x wireless or the gsp 370 but out of these microphones which ones sound the best to your years let me know in the comments and so to conclude i want to say that the pro x wireless i feel like is a welcome addition to the market despite the high price and despite the poor microphone because the audio quality thats a really good benchmark that is competing with the gsp 370 that has its own issues even though it sounds great here its pretty much smooth sailing and thats a major positive i have no issues trusting this headset and its audio performance for competitive cs go for eft and really enjoying anything in my gaming library because the sound is good it really does suck though that the surround sound experience is so much worse on the pro x wireless and the pro x versus something like the g935 but the stereo performance here is excellent i just wish that the quality across all features was more balanced in terms of like having good microphone having good surround sound but this headset has battery life comfort and sound quality going for it and everything else is secondary but yeah thats my review of the g pro x wireless let me know what you think in the comments subscribe for more check out this other relevant content and ill talk to you in the next video yeah its not

an update video on a product that I reviewed a few months back and that was the bose sound support wireless headphones when i initially made my review i raised about how great these headphones sound and how comfortable they were and how they were definitely the s phones you should be getting if youre looking for Bluetooth wireless headphones well today I have a completely different story yes I still believe that these are the most comfortable in ear boots without holes you can get out on the market today they have extremely soft flexible rubber ear tips that just conform to your very nicely doesnt push anything out of the way doesnt make it feel like its forced and theyre just kind of lays there and sits flat and I have never had a problem easier tips falling out of my ears or anything like that and yes the sound quality is still amazing its still very much up there is the most clear accurate sounding headphones bluetooth headphones that youre going to find on the market and I still think they beat out of basically all Beats Audio headphones but where they do not seem to be beating their competitors is in build quality in the last two to three weeks these headphones have been completely falling apart on me now Ive only owned these headphones for about nine months maybe ten it has definitely not been in here yet so as you can see back here this little rubber right here next to the power button has been peeling off seemingly by itself I do not know whats causing I literally wear these headphones I worked every day I never leave them in my car in the Sun or anything like that so the glue wearing away I dont know whats causing that and then back here next to the little charging port as you can see I had to remove the door that typically is shut down here to seal the soffit make them more waterresistant because the door works so much that it would no longer stay in there and stay stuck or literally just pop out whenever I pushed it in so I ended up just removing that because they got really annoying its kind of the way of me charging these headphones and then beyond that theyre working over here next to the to the port that our port is also warping and peeling off its lifting up here its lifting up off this little emblem button they have back here and its just causing way more peeling and eventually Im pretty sure this entire thing is going to peel off furthermore this little bun back here has a bulls logo on it literally popped off and sell by itself I didnt rub up against it I didnt bang it against anything I dont know what happened but it literally just fell off while I was wearing them I was sitting at my desk in my office literally not doing any sort of vigorous activity youre moving very rapidly as this sit down and it fell off by itself and it also had this little clip that holds on to the back of the wire of your headphones and keeps them nicely snug to your shirt break on me these handles back there literally broke on me I could go and buy rotational Peyronies this wasnt so much of an issue because I could literally buy it for dollar placement and the rubber warping and peeling off has only affected the right earbud where you have the power button and the door to charge the left ear but its completely fine nothing has happened without headphone at all so Im assuming this is the problem of both manufacturing process they didnt seem to compensate for the fact that youre gonna be consistently pressing the power button and removing the door to charge these headphones over and over again for a long period of time the only other issue Ive been having besides the warping in the right ear bud is connectivity for some reason now these headphones would not automatically pair with my laptop or my cell phone sometimes it will perfectly fine and then theres are sporadic times where it just will not connect at all and I have to go into the app and manually set what it will appear to and Ive also been experiencing disconnects and I feel like theyre starting to become more frequent than they ever were before so my initial review I raved about how these headphones had amazing build quality great sound quality extremely comfortable and I had no issues at the Bluetooth connection and now after 9 or 10 months Im getting do tooth connection issues almost every day the things literally falling apart on me but hey they still sound great and they are extremely comfortable still so what I still recommend the boss sounds for wireless headphones to anyone absolutely not these things do not last do not waste 100 and what is it 50 bucks on these things I would definitely pass if were going to spend that much money by the beach X and bartletts headphones Im hearing that theyre amazing they have great sound quality they dont sound like the typical beats with its just base it sounding more clearer and more accurate so Im probably going to pick those up eventually or maybe just try out the Apple earpods but anyway guys that was my update review on this I hope that helps somebody out if you were still considering buying these headphones definitely pass and if you know any other headphones any other wireless Bluetooth headphones that I should check out and I should buy instead of these headphones then definitely let me know in the comments down below because Im currently on the market but as always my name is Joshua yomyom stay sexy and Ill see you sometime you Music", "video_title": "Why You Shouldnt Buy Bose Soundsport Wireless Headphones 10 Month Review",

pair of headphones that I held off on reviewing for quite a while I dont know I guess I just wasnt like stoked on them initially but Ive been testing them out for like several weeks now and I was totally wrong theyre actually pretty legit and Im talking about the Plantronics backbeat fit Wireless sport headphones yeah I know they got a long name but its sort of worth it now before we do get into this review if youre new to my channel make sure you subscribe find that little red button below and click it and also make sure to follow me on Instagram and Twitter and yada yada yada and if you do want to check updated pricing on these bad boys or buy them Ill have a link in the description so make sure you check that out if you want and thats it lets go ahead and get to this thing so the backbeat fit our Bluetooth semi in your headphones which means that they dont have any cables that plug into your music player and theyre just completely out of the way they just hang on your head and they sit really nice theyre also really comfortable and they wrap around your ears and have like a little rubber piece that secures them in your ear I dont know I guess overall I was impressed with how comfortable they are and the fit now the other thing is that they dont completely seal off your ear canal so you can still hear some of the ambient sound I know a lot of runners actually like this because they can still be a little bit more aware of the things around them I can deal with it either way I can see the advantage of this but I also sometimes do like to have the ear buds create full sound isolation anyways though the fit is good and theyre really lightweight and theyre secure and theyre out of the way and the cable actually just sits on your head it doesnt bobble around too much which is something I was concerned about because it is a flexible cable it kind of just moves with your motion so when youre running it kind of bounces while youre bouncing and then its definitely not in the way at the gym unless youre like doing bench press and then it cant actually get in a way I thought it was going to hate this but in reality I didnt really mind it at all and the headphones are also sweat proof which is a good thing and its kind of necessary if theyre workout headphones but I thought I should make sure that I noted that and the sound is good for sure I mean if were talking about headphones thats important and I think its good its good enough for me and probably for the average gym goer and I dont think youll be disappointed with the sound at all now with wireless earphones there always is one catch yes theyre less invasive and theyre more portable etc but battery life is usually the Achilles heel because you dont have like a lot of room to put a battery but with the back beats I was really impressed with the battery life I was getting like three to five workouts on a single charge maybe like six seven eight hours on a single charge and when you do charge them its micro USB so you dont need like a special cable I was actually really really impressed with the battery life so I do think that that is a positive but the other thing that can be an issue is compatibility the backbeats support all iOS functions and they work with Android devices as well but I think the experience for iOS users will be better they also do have a mic so you can take and make phone calls and access Syria etc and they have a full remote system however its much different than any other headphones Ive ever used so you will want to consult that manual before you like try and test out these headphones theres nothing wrong with the remote system and actually its kind of intuitive to like press on your ear to access all the buttons but its not like youre going to pick these things up and immediately know how to use them so definitely check out that manual but overall the back beats are impressive and I do think that theyre like totally overlooked by like everybody most consumers probably have never heard of them but I thought that theyre really impressive they even have a four and a half star rating on Amazon with like nearly 2000 people rating them its pretty crazy and I think theyre a good value at right around 80 thats not that expensive and theyre pretty good headphones so if youre in the market for new workout headphones definitely at least try them out give them a go and if you do want to buy them or just check updated pricing make sure to check out that link in the description and thats it for this video I do hope you enjoyed it and found it helpful and if you did click that thumbs up button below it will write me a comment otherwise I dont know if you guys actually like this stuff and also make sure to check out rizz nose

on the brandnew Beats Studio Street Wireless so of course it does have that 22 hour of battery life which is really good it does have NAC which is adaptive noise cancelling which you can actually turn it on and turn it off as well so there you go that is the back of the box so now lets turn around and its open it for the first time alright so lets take out the slipcover off just like that as you can see here in the middle we got that gold beats logo which is awesome look at that that is really really cool give you guys a 360 view there you go so now lets open them up and lets see what we get inside this lovely box so as soon as you open the box you are greeted with this message and it does say change the way you hear sound alright so lets take out this slipcover just like that so the first thing you see inside the box is your carrying case not inside this carrying case is of course your headphones so lets actually take a map whoa whoa whoa pretty slippery carrying case I say we go

"20201007 102245936800", "video_id": "CTTqIlLfsww", "Closed Captions": " Music due to phone manufacturers opting out of the standard headphone jack we are experiencing a rapid increase in demand for affordable bluetooth headphones now jbl meets this demand with their eseries line of headphones we happen to have the 55 bluetooth edition in red with us which is also why im seated in this red childrens chair and i may or may not have broken my office chair anyways im lily katz and today we are going to figure out if these are worth your 120 or if youre better off subjecting your ears to something else all right lets shake right into it jbl includes the necessities with the e55bt a 35 millimeter headphone jack a micro usb cable and thats it these are technically classified as budget headphones and it shows though the plastic housing squeaks and creaks in the hand this fortunately disappears when youre wearing them its cool that the fabric headband matches the tangle free cable but at first glance it provides as much cushioning as a piece of cardboard normally this would be problematic but the ergonomic weight distribution means that these can be worn for an hour and a half without fatigue even with glasses i found these to be just fine similarly to the biodynamic dt240 pro jbl has opted for synthetic protein leather ear pads not only does this keep costs down but it also appeals to a wider range of consumers design wise call me picky but the 50 millimeter driver housing protrudes way too much relative to the flat headband and generally speaking features are slim if you want a corny joke looks like youre gonna have to phone dad because jbl doesnt include virtual assistant compatibility the right ear cup is outfitted with the power switch and basic playback controls and i mean vanilla bean frappuccino basic theres also a multiconnect button included on that same side the controls arent great and all three buttons sit perfectly flush with each other this means that using them is a complete guess and check process i didnt like that method in high school algebra and i dont like it now connectivity lags but it doesnt drag if youre streaming video theres a half second to full second delay this isnt ideal especially in a 120 pair of headphones personally i would have preferred aptx compatibility over multiconnect functionality but you win some you lose some and i guess you tie some both jacks on the tangle resistant cloth cable are reinforced with strong stress relievers and the optimist in me thinks that itll hold up for a while with volume at 50 i was able to exhaust the full 20 hours of music playback from the headphones even at 50 these are loud theres no way that anyone could safely listen to them at that level for more than a few minutes tops i found myself hovering somewhere around a quarter to a third of the volume when you do eventually run out of juice it takes a full two hours via micro usb for the headphones to top back up looking beyond the iffy connectivity jbl has tuned the e55 headphones to have an altered sound signature this isnt necessarily a bad thing as its enjoyable and meets what most consumers like emphasize bass and highs relative to the mids just dont expect to get a good mix out of them because these are not reference headphones the over ear design helps to create a wider sound stage by taking advantage of the natural contours of our ear now katy perrys swish swish is a prime example of how altered lowend sound can be advantageous for certain genres supposedly response to taylor swifts bad blood if youre one for celebrity feuds swish swish that is hard to say relies on an energetic tempo at 120 beats per minute to carry the nightlife inspired beat overemphasis of the lows pushes into the mids resulting in a drop in vocal clarity for the sake of a more fun sound the bass is much more energetic than listening with something like the audio technica ath m40x which is okay because both headphones have their respective places on the audio stage each is a tool for a specific purpose though not a radio hit lords sober has plenty of dynamic range to test the fidelity of the mids like swish swish still difficult for me to say the song is overtaken by exaggerated lows while appealing this formulaic beat undercuts lords vocals causing them to sound recessed hindering the vocals isnt typically a huge issue with poppier rhythms but the song is so lyrically driven that it just doesnt work circling back to the sound stage its actually one of the best aspects of the e55 bt sound in the last 30 seconds of sober the lyrics limelight lose my mind repeat through the right channel as the refrain comes through the left and right channels lords voice is easy to perceive as distant relative to the repeated lyrics which sound as if theyre being sung less than a foot away from the right ear on to the trouble edgar meyer and chris tyle duet in why only one the reproduction of meyers upright base performance perceptibly lops off detail from tiles agile mandolin picking upon initial listening the higher end of the spectrum comes through clearly however this is the highest end of the frequency range that were hearing in the song hence why it sounds so appealing at first listening closer reveals that there isnt much below that point due to the overemphasis of the base which ends up eating into both the upper mid range and the lower end of the treble though the rickety plastic is often too malleable the fact of the matter is that if youre on a budget but you want to dip your toe or even your whole foot into the next echelon of audio the jbl e55bt are worth considering good sound quality is always a gamble with bluetooth headphones especially due to unpredictable interference issues bots the e55bt work well and reproduce a superb soundstage yes yes and yes the sound isnt flat but it is not meant to be rather the eseries is a fun affordable line that brings multiconnect capabilities comfort and good sound to the table all right well that about wraps things up for our review of the jbl e55 bluetooth headphones if you liked what you saw let us know hit

Captions": " hey everyone Parker from Digital Trends here and I am here with some of our favorite true wireless headphones now true wireless headphones are a very interesting market segment right now because they are evolving so quickly were getting new chipsets better battery life better sound and more all this year so deciding what pair youre gonna want to buy is increasingly difficult here are our favorites and why Music these are the true wireless headphones you are probably most familiar with theyre apples air pods and this is the new version with the wireless charging case were not the biggest fan of the sort of golf tee design of these headphones but there are a couple reasons that you might consider buying them we call them the best for iOS users or Apple users because frankly they are they connect very quickly and the other thing that they have going for them is this charging case the charging case has a total of 19 hours of battery life in it and the headphones themselves have 5 hours of battery life for a total of 24 hours of listening time on the go that is still pretty good even with the advancements that other headphones have seen if you like the look of the air pods but you want something thats a little bit more rugged you might consider buying the rh8 they have the same sort of golf tee look but in a matte black and the other things they have going for them are rubber ear tips for a better seal and an IP x5 rating which means you can take them outside in the rain you can workout in them and youll never worry about damaging your headphones that better seal means youll get better sound quality overall and battery life matches the air pods at five hours per charge but this sleek little charging case vest them by one hour giving you 20 hours of charge from this cool case if youre more of a workout enthusiasts and you want something thats a little bit more ergonomic in your ear the best headphones for you are likely the Jabra Elite Act of 65 T those headphones have an IP 56 ratings so theyre waterproof dustproof and sweat proof they offer five hours of battery life great audio quality thanks to nice silicone ear tips and the elite active 65 t also give you access to Google assistant should you need to ask a question or set a timer for your workout if youre looking for the highest quality sound from a pair of true wireless headphones theres really only one great option and that is the sennheiser momentum wireless these headphones sacrifice an hour of battery life in favor of optics and bluetooth 50 but they boast sort of the same gergan amma cos im weve seen on other headphones and they sound absolutely incredible they offer beautiful highs crisp mids and bumping lows giving you the best dynamics and the widest soundstage that youll hear from true wireless headphones they come in this beautiful tweed hard case and unfortunately though the case is beautiful it only offers you eight hours of charge so youll get a total of twelve hours of charge with these headphones that said if youre looking for fidelity in true wireless headphones this is the only way to go now all the other headphones weve talked about so far run in the 150 to 175 dollar range whereas these Sennheisers will set you back 300 big ones now you do get what you pay for in terms of audio quality but whether or not that sound is worth it for you thats up to you last but not least we have the Samsung Galaxy buds these are currently our favorite true wireless headphones for a number of reasons first and foremost is that they are incredibly small and incredibly comfortable second they offer you six hours per charge so you can listen to your favorite music for an hour longer than Apples air pods and other competitors like the RHA tick pods their silicone ear tips block in sound and the sound quality is easily on par with any of the rest of these save these 300 Sennheisers making them an incredible value at just a hundred and twentyfive dollars new that hundred twentyfive bucks also gets you this beautiful wireless charging case which will charge off the back of a brand new Samsung phone as well as on a Samsung charging pad Apple on the other hand will charge you a 40 surcharge to get the charging case with their one hundred and sixty dollar headphones making this an insane deal at eighty dollars less than the air pods for the headphones plus the charging case the other thing these have going for them they have an IP x2 rating admittedly not the greatest sweatproof rating but still beats the air pods and makes them our favorite true wireless headphones you can buy hey everyone thank you for watching be sure to comment below about what your favorite two wireless headphones are and check out our comparison videos and

budget oriented uh on the year headphones for from infinity indirectly jbl and this is the glide 510 water theres also another model that is known as light 500 thats the slightly older one and that was uh selling for about 1500 this one sells for about 1800 and lets see what we get on the box and as you can see uh they say base and it has dual equalizer for extended base and then normal ill talk about the sound signature later on and uh its the big thing is that it says 72 hours worth of battery life and indeed the battery life is really good i couldnt test it for that 72 hours but indeed the battery life is good so this is what you get in the box uh basic blocks that you get ill just keep this to the side for now and these are the uh what do you say uh earphones and guys uh these are actually on the ear headphones so they sit over the your ears they dont completely cover you so thats a distinction and if youre not used to these kind of earphones it might take you a day or two to get used to it but before we jump lets talk about the physical overview and uh what i feel and it says uh infinity the branding over here and guys the entire thing is actually made up of plastic so entirely it is plastic guys it feels a little bit on the cheaper side especially the buttons over here its connected via bluetooth uh they feel actually cheap on the right hand side actually we have all the buttons for example the volume rocker and here we have a led light when its connected this is the power off button that we have and we also have the microphone here and here we have the micro usb port that will be used for charging uh the left ear cup for some strange reason we dont have any buttons it just says infinity on both the sides like this and the ear cups they have decent cushion i would say considering the price point of this one uh but i do feel initially uh you will feel that the clamping force is slightly on the higher side as you can see it wont break if you do like this see im doing like this but initially uh youll feel that the clamping force is slightly tighter so it might take some time to get used to it will get a little bit loose initially the first day it was quite high uh but now ive gotten used to it and uh this is a good thing and a bad thing also it sits over your ears i would say so uh the thing is that even after about half an hour your ears wont get hot because there is a little bit of air circulation on it but again uh its on here its not totally so its a different sort of an experience you will have to get used to it and it doesnt have any active noise cancellation or anything because it just sits over here it does what do you say block a little bit of uh quite a bit of sound around you uh so but no active noise cancellation and anything uh but first lets talk about the work from home uh aspect of this because we i know many of us are actually working from home and we to do video conferencing calls etc first lets talk about that aspect and then well talk about the music aspect what do i feel about this one and uh the good thing that i like on this one is the battery life that im getting it says about 72 hours i couldnt uh test that completely but even after about now it must been used about 15 16 hours or something like that and it was showing me about uh 72 about 70 battery so again the battery life is really good and for work from home if you are also daily you have to wear this for a couple of hours also then i feel it can last for about almost a week of usage like this so in that respect i would say the battery life is very good uh coming to the bluetooth connection uh again one thing to note is that again guys its only a bluetooth connection we dont have any vag connection or aux port on this one so if you are thinking that you will connect it via aux port or something like that thats not the case this is a pure bluetooth uh what do you say headphones uh but the bluetooth connection was surprisingly good on this uh one and it did not disconnect even when was under the roof the room sitting in this one and i was taking calls that brings me to the microphone surprisingly the microphone quality on this one is much better than many of the expensive headphones that i have tested for example even sony and sennheiser so that way the microphone quality is good but again dont expect any active noise cancellation or anything for example uh in a normal situation like you are in the room or etc uh the call quality was very good uh the microphone is good other parties never complain but when i went outside slightly it does pick up a lot of street uh sound so there is no active noise cancellation so that is something but again if youre sitting in your house and taking calls the microphone quality is surprisingly actually good i took a lot of calls hours and hours of calls on this one and no one actually complained that i was sounding muffled or anything so that way i feel it is good for what you say that work from home thing that is happening a lot youre thinking if you are a person who takes a lot of calls and i feel uh because these actually do not weigh that much and let me show you with this weighing skin let it reset yeah and as you can see just about 115 grams that it has its actually pretty light also on your head that way you can actually wear this for a couple of hours and youll be okay because after some time you dont feel its there the only thing is that as i told you the clamping force initially will be a little bit high so you might have to like pull it out for after half an hour like this and get used to it but uh otherwise uh because of the battery life and the call quality that im getting or bluetooth i feel for work from home this is actually really good now lets talk about what do i feel about the sound of this one and when you get it uh i would say by default this is actually said to that excess base stone and it sounds horrible on that one horrible means the base is so much that it makes you crazy i think so they just equalized it like this the base curve uh fortunately you can change it uh to do that what you have to do is when the headphone is on you have to press both these buttons the volume up and down for a second and then it moves to the normal mode and i used it mostly on the normal mode because i felt that the bass was just too excessive in the regular bass enhanced mode uh so unless you are a bass head just avoid it because even in the normal mode i felt that the bass is actually enhanced quite a bit in fact if you recall recently i had uh reviewed this one the sony uh and this they say is extra bass in fact i would say even in the normal mode this one sounds actually has extra bass than even this one so you get it even in the normal mode the bass is quite enhanced on this one but i feel many uh youngsters actually like that enhanced bass in fact my daughter enjoyed the sound signature on this one definitely boosted bass so for edms rap etc youll really enjoy it but again if youre sort of a purist you dont like that excessive bass because even in the normal mode it has excessive bass you might not like but considering on the box it says bass enhanced if i have to say uh the base rating i would rate it 85 out of 10 now coming to the mid tones here again i think they didnt do anything uh the midtones the vocals are not getting enhanced or they are not forward sounding and the bass slightly leaks even in that so it does give that impression of again bass enhance even in the normal mode uh but uh for vocals and stuff i would say they were actually really nicely produced on this one and if i have to rate it uh for the vocals and stuff ill rate it about eight out of ten now moving to the higher tones higher frequency treble tones that we talked uh here i felt they it was slightly lacking uh dont get me wrong uh for most of the headphones in this range actually they were produced very well but if i have to be critical about it i would say i did miss that slight sparkle on the treble side with this one and if i have to rate it overall on the trebles high frequencies i would rate it about 75 out of 10 the sound stage and the stereo imaging was good i did also watch quite a bit of movies on this one and watched a lot of youtube videos and the movies actually sounded very good on this one that the explosions etc because of that enhanced base even the normal world they sounded very well on this one uh but the only thing is that for example on netflix uh i felt that even at the maximum volume level the volume was simply not that loud compared to many other earphones and stuff uh for music that was not a problem generally i would say when i test headphones and all this i generally keep the volume level at about 60 thats comfortable to me but on this one i had to keep it about 80 percent so again these are not the loudest if youre a person who likes to list very very loud music then you might not like this one uh coming to latency in terms of video and what do you say uh youtube videos and netflix right now watching the good thing is that i did not notice that lip syncing issue but some of you keep asking me about gaming uh gaming if you do you will if you carefully notice very carefully notice you will notice that micro lag there but again that is present even on my bose qc35 so uh you just cant compare that almost no gaming latency very few headsets provide that but if i were to tell any casual player he wouldnt have noticed that uh now moving to uh what do you say uh the overall impressions that i have with this one in terms of sound if i just talk about it yes you know its enhanced base then i would rate it about eight out of ten but again the uh the build quality is totally plastic on this that is something that i do not like and when youre listening to music and you press these buttons they give you that feeling of cheap build quality that is something that i have noticed but uh again i like the fact that the battery life on this one is really really good the microphone for the work from home is good and also in terms of the sound signature uh they do sound actually good if you are a person who enjoys slightly exaggerated bass even in the normal mode then you might like it i hope i just wish the build quality was better because it its simply just too much plasticky feeling that you get but still considering some of the options that we have in this price point and this coming from infinity indirectly a jbl company i feel its a decent product and uh i would rate it uh about 775 out of 10 anyways guys thats it for the review of this one i have also reviewed other budget oriented earphones headphones highend headphones ill leave the playlist for your reference in the description below anyways guys thats it for now thanks for watching this is ranjit and i hope to see you in my next video take care

electronics and today were going to be talking about the Silla 3 Wireless that counterfeit pairs that weve been getting in is to show you guys the difference between fair fake pairs that we get in from repairs we go through them and identify them as fakes well send them back to the customer or the real pairs that we saw here and there whats really interesting about the market right now is people arent catching on really nicely these factories that are doing them arent getting really clever about the way they match the paints the way they match the hinges but what were gonna show you is a difference thats going on the inside the headphones along with two quick ways you can identify if you have a fake pair or a real pair the really easy way to do this is if you take your headphones and you plug them into the microUSB we download the Beats updater well link it up in our description and then if your updater can actually register your beats through the website then you know you have an authentic paired the real pair you connect it to the microUSB connect it to your computer and you can register it through the beats by dre website on the fake pair you cannot do that thats a really easy way and the way that you can do this at home plug it in take care of it the second easiest way would be to go ahead and put them both into pairing mode when you put these into pairing mode since the solo threes and all three generation products made by Apple have the w1 chip theyll connect really easily to your device and because of that its really simple to tell if you have a w1 chip inside it and if you do theres a really good chance its real item so well go ahead and put this into pairing mode well put this into pairing mode by holding the power button pull the power button for a few seconds and then the lights will start flashing when they do on your device youll see your solo threes pop up and youll simply connect them and when you do connect them thats how you know that you have an authentic pair of solo trees were going to show you guys a few different things as well so right here we have the counterfeit pair and my favorite thing when people say hey I have a fake pair and we get it in and then we tell you that its a fake pair you say oh but it came in a box and it was new of course its gonna be new so this is the fake pair its new right has all these stickers on here because it has stickers that does not mean that you have an authentic pair because it comes in a box does not mean how do you have an authentic pair whats inside the box is it gonna identify if you have an authentic pair or not were gonna look at the first thing which is the logo if you look at the logo right here the B is actually a little shiny and if you look at the logo here its a matte and the fake bear has the matte and the real pair has a shine and it matches the hinge the hinges are glossy the hinges are glossy here to look at the headbands the real pair has a light grey beats on top and the fake pair has this white beads on top and overall you the two easiest ways is to just use the w1 chip connection and using the website to identify that my favorite thing to do is put these on the scale and show you guys how to check with the scale not authentic beats use inferior parts which are not as heavy since theyre cheaper and were going to go ahead and put this on the scale and show you guys the difference between one and the other so well tear this out and its a few ounces but since we deal with these every day we ship thousands of these out its really easy to identify a big formal reel and were gonna show you guys here with the weight so we got that fake pair here were gonna put it on I have 7 ounces and then well put this authentic pair one we have seven point six ounces its about 610 of an ounce as the difference its not super big but its just another way to identify if your beats are fake or not alright and really the last quick and easy way to tell is if you look at the serial numbers here the serial numbers will be on both both of them have a serial number but if you look at the one thats authentic its very easy to read it looks like its almost damn tender even though it is printed and it does look a good stamp its very uniform the way it is were gonna actually post some pictures in this video as you guys can identify that difference and the authentic and fake ones both have it but the fake one is just mimicking a serial number thats what didnt Apples database so if you call the serial number and it may be an authentic serial number but there just may be a thousand of them with that same exact serial number so thats kind of the couple unique features about that now what were gonna do is go a little further inside that fake headphones which are these right here when I tear them down and show you guys whats going on with a fake headphone so Im just gonna take it and snap them right here so there is the inside of your fake headphones and if you look right here hair is your green board that board should look something like this its black of course I would want you to snap in your headphones we dont recommend doing this because you cant return this back to the vendor if you decide to break it but this is just a quick way we can show you guys so the board on the inside here is a green has no technology and it just typical Bluetooth and thats right there if we take the other side were gonna go ahead and break this off pop this inside panel off and see whats going on here so here is the battery if you look here this is the fake battery this is the real battery looks at the fake battery is 350 milliamps the real battery is also 350 milliamps theres different types and if you look at the power board the power board is green the power board should be black also low 3 Studio 3 power beats 3 Ill have a black PCB just so you know so thats that and then were gonna do a quick muff test so were gonna peel this muff off you can just tip just your fingertip underneath and pop right off its fake its gonna come out very easy so here is the muff thats counterfeit there is real month one quick way to tell if its real or fake is the fake counter that counterfeit pairs will have more of a glossy finish on the leather and the real ones were having more of a matte finish and itll be just a better looking muffin general the material they use is much better were gonna take a knife and cut this token so this is that counterfeit here and if you look at the counterfeit pair here you can actually see right through here you can see right through its much easier to see if its a white pair but you can see right through if you put something behind it if you look at the legit pair theres a lot of padding behind there and you cant see directly through but were gonna take this fake pair and cut it open if you look inside here this foam here is blue its a very common foam use its very cheap youll see a lot of student you the two months with this really crappy blue foam and this is a lot of the stuff that fake companies are using because the cheapest bill of materials they want to create it sell it and move on and well go ahead and open authentic them off what youll see on the inside is a really nice slow rebound foam which will be yellow and some of them use black as well it depends what factory theyre made in so those are the couple things that we could do to help you guys out just identify what is real what is fake the counterfeit here here is fake and try to do your best to state to secure websites we sell

which also doubles up as the power button theres also a nicelooking LED above the button so that you know that your phone is paired to the headphones when it blinks blue now these headphones offer up an average battery life of about 9 to 10 hours which should be useful for a lot of people especially if you are using the headphones throughout the day 9 to 10 hours should be good enough for a full days use if you are a heavy listener or a weeks use if you are a light listener as well the headphones are also well cushioned with a nice head cushion as well as ear cushions on both the ear pads are really soft and comfortable the headphones are also lightweight weighing in only at 230 grams the sound profile is overall pretty well balanced a good amount of bass and midtones are also well matched theres not a lot of volume in these headphones unless youre using some sort of an amp because they do have an inbuilt 35 mm headphone jack as well so if you have boosted audio youll get really good volumes from this but if you are using these over Bluetooth you might like to hear a little bit more audio if you are somebody who listens to their headphones turned up to max but overall the sound profile is good the headphones are lightweight and comfortable theyre available in a bunch of colors and theyre available for a good price as well so go check these out next up on our list for a price of 1289 are the Motorola escape 200 over the Year headphones now these headphones are available in a onair style as well so if you dont like over the ear headphones you can choose the onair style these are super lightweight they offer up 15 hours of playtime have 40mm drivers and are made out of a really good quality plastic as well the foam pads are really nice and soft and cushiony the headphones have a lot of stretch in the headband as well so you can really put them on and they are comfortable to wear for long periods of time we found the sound profile to be slightly flat so if you enjoy flatter sound profiles if youre not going to be boosting the bass quite a lot these headphones should match up they also have a novelty feature where in which you can trigger alexis city or google now directly from the headphones so if you have any of those assistants that you use you can use them with the Motorola Escape headphones they do have an inbuilt microphone for phone calls as well and you do have a 35 mm headphone jack if you want to use them as wired headphones so all in all a pretty good set for the price that they are available at go check these out next up on our list for under 1000 rupees of the eyeball decibel are the ones that we got our gold in color and they look fantastic according to me but theyre also available in an all black for a subtle look and blue and silver and another blue and silver with the silver ear cushions as well so depending on what color profile you want there quite a lot of options here and theyre priced under 1000 piece now the one thing that youll notice right off the bat with these is the way that the right side and the left side ear cups are shaped when you put them on like regular headphones they are slightly awkward while fitting on your ear so you have to tilt the headband back a little bit to get a slightly better fit ideally they would have been better if they were reversed so if the left side was on the right side and the audio profile was configured like that then these would have been better if eating headphones so I dont know what the design choice was but the color scheme the ear cups as well as the headband are really nice and soft so theyre comfortable for long periods of use theyre also quite flexible and fold down for easy transport they also have a 35 mm headphone jack so if youre somebody who wants to listen to audio on a cable you can do that as well these earphones also have FM radio so if youre somebody who listens to FM radio these will come in handy for that as well again just like our the previous headphones the eyeball decibel is Alexa enabled so if you have Google or Alexa you can launch it from the eyeball decibel and use it to tell Alexa your commands as well as the sound profile is concerned the headphones sound good they do distort a little bit on the maximum volume but if you are one step down they sound amazing good amounts of bass good amount of midrange and for the price you cant really complain really good overall package considering the colors and they are lightweight they should last you about eight to ten hours in terms of battery life depending on how you are listening to them overall a good package for the price under 1000 please go check these out so the final headphones on our list are the Infinity Glide 500 wireless headphones now these are a sub brand of JBL really good quality build materials on these headphones a really solid headband along with a lot of flex in the headband as well really soft cushions on the ear cuffs they dont have any cushioning on the headband and the size of the headphones can also be extended to make it quite large as far as the drivers are concerned theyre 32 mm drivers and a really good quality sound from these there is a 200 milliamp hour battery that charges up in about one and a half to two hours they also offer up speed charging in ten minutes and they offer up upwards of 18 to 20 hours of usage on these headphones which is absolutely fantastic they are voice assistant enabled so if you are using City Google assistant or even Alexa they will work directly on the headphones without any problem they do have an inbuilt microphone so if you want to make your voice calls you can do that as well they are lacking a headphone jack so youll not be able to connect a auxiliary cable directly to the headphones theyre also available in three colors black that we have over here blue and red and overall the sound profile is extremely well balanced are really good amounts of bass on these headphones one of the best in the lot good amount of midrange as well if you are somebody who likes a lot of bass out of the folder of the JBL infiniti definitely get the pick for the maximum amount of bass and a really good quality fit they are slightly tight on the ear and do pinch in on the head but allinall an extremely well balanced headphone for the price definitely go check these out so thats it for this list guys if you like lots of bass definitely go pick the JBL Clyde if youre somebody who wants FM radio on their headphones you can pick the eyeball decibel if you want a flat sound which you can tweak around with an equalizer on your smartphone maybe you can go for the Motorola escape and if youre somebody whos using some sort of an amp or would like to boost the audio from the PC or your smartphone if it has a DAC enabled then you can definitely go for the boat headphones all in all a good pick under the 2000 degree price bracket ranging all the way from under 1000 all the way up to 18 99 go check these out if you liked the video guys dont forget to smash the like button hit the subscribe button if you want to see more top tech videos as always guys if you have the bail

welcome to my review on the sony MDR RF 985 wireless headphones so these are headphones that work great for watching movies or TV even YouTube videos on your computer so Ill be talking more about the sound quality features and comfort of these headphones I think for a lot of people these are a great value especially considering theyre under 100 but theres a few reasons you might want to consider something else or something a little bit nicer so Ill talk more about that as well also check below for any updates about these headphones including where to get them at for the best price also include a link to a group review Im doing on wireless headphones doing basically a headtohead kind of sidebyside comparison to help you figure out which one might be the best choice for you so again check below if youre interested in a link to that video so go ahead and walk you through the features of these headphones and show you how the basically how they work and give you a quick idea for the setup so these do come with your RCA cables and how this works is it depends on your audio source if your audio source has a right and left output you can go ahead and plug this into the output of your audio source and plug this into your audio input to hear if however your TV or bluray player or whatever only has a single audio output you plug this cable into that audio output and then you can go ahead and plug these into your audio in one so either option works great you have a three different channels here you can select so this is something to help make sure you have the the best signal of course this comes with the AC adapters your power source and that just plugs in right here in terms of the battery life these last up to 25 hours it will depend on how loud you listen to your music or movies and what youre listening to the first time you charges itll take about 35 hours and then after that it just depends on how drained they are to recharge the headphones they just basically sit on here and then youll see a little red light come on letting letting you know that theyre charging now you can use these with your TV with your bluray player with your PC as long as whatever youre using them with has an audio out I know one question people will have is can you use multiple headphones with this particular receiver and the answer is yes you can actually use an unlimited number of headphones with this base or receiver now regarding the differ buttons you have you have your power on and off here so again when thats off you just turn it on and it will connect seems seamlessly with whatever youre listening to these did a really great job of that they pair it really quickly like just within a split second over here you have your volume and you just basically scroll this down or up depending on how loud and basically has numbers going from zero to ten which is which is helpful so if you know theres a volume you usually like to have that you can actually just look and see to make sure its at the correct volume so I actually really like that feature in terms of the ear padding these are comfortable theyre kind of that oldschool look as far as the padding goes but as you can see theyre definitely nice and big ear cups there so I think anyones ear should fit comfortably in here I know these actually feel a little bit big on my head but definitely comfortable also as you can see the ear cups do pivot back and forth here they dont pivot sidetoside but regardless youre still able to get a really comfortable fit and then in terms of the headband up top here also very comfortable you notice theres no cushion right here at the very top where it charges and thats not a problem at all I wouldnt worry about that these are still very comfortable now one thing I will note about these is they do kind of have that plasticky feel and you can kind of hear a little bit now obviously when these are on your head youre not flopping the ear cups around but you know just if thats important to you just something to consider as far as adjusting the headband itself has a click adjustment which is great so you can find a comfortable fit that way so in terms of the actual wireless signal these have a range of up to 150 feet what I found for myself experientially was I could definitely walk around the first floor no problem even the second floor but when I went up to the third floor I started to get some more static so what that means is you theres certainly the range will depend on how many walls youre going through and you know in your distant in distance from the base or receiver that way but I feel like these should have plenty of range for anyone you know lets say youre watching TV or a movie and then you want to go to the kitchen grab a snack and then come back and just not have to you know pause whatever youre listening to these should work just fine for that now in terms of the clarity of the signal whats interesting is the first time I use these I notice just a little bit of static but I played around with them I played around with the channels I also just unplugged and replugged everything in and then when I listen to him again it was crystal clear so just keep that in mind if you end up getting these for yourself and you do notice a little bit of static and Ive seen that some of the reviews on these as well just try tweaking them a little bit playing around unplug replug in some stuff and see if that makes a difference and then once once like I said I got a really clear signal they sounded great so theres no static no hiss it was a really nice signal now I did get one pause where there was just a slight pause in you know I was watching a movie where the audio just went silent for like a split second otherwise everythings been really smooth and easy to listen to signal wise with these so next I want to give you a live sound leak test to get an idea of how much sound leaks out of these at different volume levels now this the volume adjustment goes from basically zero on up to ten so start it out at three and then increase the volumes to get an idea here so Ill go ahead and turn them on and theyre at three starting out here so this is what I consider a semi quiet volume here you may not be able to hear anything right now and then Im going to look at this and turn it up to say six this is definitely a good volume to listen at and then Ill turn it all the way up to ten so you can hear it out of the headphones and Ill put them on so again this is full volume so hopefully that gives you an idea of how much sound leaks out of these again at different volume levels the nice thing is they dont leak as much sound is say more open headphones would so if youre trying to enjoy a movie or watching TV and you have someone next to you that maybe theyre sleeping or you just dont want them to hear what youre watching these certainly could do a pretty good job for you that way now in terms of the volume I find it goes plenty loud for me again turning it up all the way I really wouldnt want to go beyond that I even even thats a little bit too loud for me to watch a whole movie at but if you really like loud volume you may find that these dont quite get loud enough for you so next I want to talk about the sound quality of these overall these do a nice job you know I would kind of say 4 out of 5 stars the bass is there its present so that it really rounds out movies in particular so for instance when I was watching Tron Daft Punk is playing in the background quite a bit theres just lots of bass in that movie and these do a nice job I felt like it was enjoyable you get some of that punchy you know you get some of that hitting hard hitting bass not its not particularly hard hitting or throbbing and its not particularly tight and refined but it does a good enough job that it makes the movie fun to watch same thing for Pirates of the Caribbean you know sometimes you have the boom of the cannon or you know whatever it is and you feel like okay cool there is enough bass in there to kind of bring it to life and it make me you know ultimately feel satisfied about the listening experience so the mids and the highs likewise they do a nice job I wasnt blown away but ultimately I felt satisfied like yeah theres enough detail theres enough clarity they definitely add to the experience and ultimately for me thats what Im looking for especially for movies now to be critical I would say they are a little bit tinny sounding and at higher volumes I felt like that listening fatigued or listener fatigue can kind of set in to where you know its hard to listen to these at loud volumes for long periods of time so thats me personally getting your experience maybe a little bit but thats what I found with these but regardless I felt like they still did a really nice job and definitely a good value for the money now in another positive note one thing they did an exceptional job of really is being able to give you good dialogue and also balance out background music or explosions and things like that sometimes what can happen particularly when youre watching movies is youll get these loud explosions or the soundtrack will kick in and its so loud you have to turn it down and then people start talking and theyre too quiet so you got to turn it up again and youre just going back and forth and its annoying I cant stand that but these definitely dont do that at all its really well balanced so voices you can definitely hear what people are saying so for example lets say youre watching TV with others and youre someone who always asks people to turn the tv up so you can hear what theyre saying and theyre like no the TV is too loud what are you talking about these would be great you can put these on you can turn it up and definitely hear what people are saying and get it the same you know token these dont leak a lot of sounds youre not going to bother them all so they stay synced in terms of with the TV so its not like you see peoples lips moving and and its mismatched or any any of that so they work really great that way so bottom line the sound quality of these is good definitely should satisfy I think most people especially if you have the right perspective youre not expecting these to sound like headphones that cost two to three times as much but ultimately youre getting your moneys worth and youre getting a really nice sound experience so go and wrap things up with some final thoughts my recommendation regarding these particular wireless headphones by Sony what I like most about these headphones is the fact that I consider them more of a budgetfriendly wireless headphones youre under 100 youre getting headphones that sound nice and they are very comfortable I mean you can really wear these all day long also I really like that you can watch movies or TV and they balance out sound from whether its dialogue to background music to explosions so nothing is out of out of balance there where youre having to turn the volume up and down all the time it does a great job of keeping everything evenkeeled now some reasons you may want to consider other headphones would be one of course from a sound quality standpoint if you really want a higher sound quality you want a tighter bass you want more refined mids and highs you really want the hair to stand up on the back of your neck when youre watching a movie then thats where you want to look at spending more money its not so much a different pair of headphones at this price point its more about spending more money to get that kind of effect if its not a big deal or you really dont want to spend more than 100 on you know wireless headphones to use these would be a excellent choice theyre super comfortable they sound good they really get the job done so hopefully this review was helpful for you as always leave a thumbs up if it was I appreciate that and do check below again for any updates about these headphones especially where you can get them at for the best price and also if youre interested in the group wireless headphone review check below for a link to

of these new wireless earbuds that they put out one of them is called sprint which these ones ones called jump and the other ones called something else whatever Ive maybe I dont know theyre all forms of exercise anyway I wanted to sprint ones I need a good pair if you know wireless earbuds working out was kind of sick of using my Apple earbuds they werent Wireless of the wired ones and you know the wire just gets in the way now Im one of that first of all but also somebody wanted something that was you know a little more durable I wanted you know these earbuds that were sweat proof and honestly so far these have really just hit the mark I mean theyve been theyve been really good bluetooth is excellent Bluetooth has some pretty solid range to it you know I can step away like you know 10 feet or whatever from my phone and do some you know pull like pushups or crunches whatever and like I said I can still get my music on and they also charge super fast like right out of the box it only took about 10 minutes and I got a good like hour of listening time in before they started to die so they do charge with a fast sound quality on them which is you know obviously the biggest thing or for a lot of people its the big thing when when spending this kind of money on on your buds sound quality in my opinion is pretty great for the price and I own some very very high fidelity headphones and so I know what you know I think I feel like I have a good idea of what good sound is and you know I think for for the price I mean these produce like a pretty good sound I dont know what kind of drivers are using but its its nice theres definitely a little bit of hype in the treble so thats one thing you know youre definitely gonna hear when I say that I mean like the higher sounds youre gonna hear those a little little crispier than the lower sounds so thats thats one thing to keep in mind especially if youre used to something like beats which have that like really fat bass response a little different but you can definitely hear other than that you know you cant you get a pretty pretty true true sound with you know your music and thats thats awesome so small price so this thing they are they I do have touch controls so this one right there no it must be dead anyway basically what you do is you can there you go so you hold it down for a couple of seconds ends on EPEL thats on so thats kind of cool and then can you know kind of turn them off move it up and down to change the volume double tap to ask for it or or rewind or whatever I will say while thats like pretty cool that its like touch like that touch not really touchscreen but touch control whatever they are little finicky you know Ive definitely like I was running the other night and you know I tried to like press it and it just like kept pausing instead of skipping and I was trying to double tap and then when I was trying to pause it would double tap and skip and and even like a little like drop a sweat our big whatever big drop of sweat and change it so thats one thing they could have had maybe done a little better but it works and I control all the stuff in my phone anyway so I dont think you know its totally like a big deal for me but you know and then the design the secureness i guess you could say that took me a little little while to get used to so essentially you take it you face it down put it in your ear like that and then you twist it and this part is basically shapes like the inner piece of your ear so youll notice that it like twists in there and then sticks the cool thing is it does get very very secure so you dont have to worry about these falling out at all even if they do you know you have this little line so that can kind of hold on to them and save them but they do feel like really tight at first so theyre gonna take a while to get used to its almost like like breaking in a new pair of shoes or something like that you know other than that even they have a very ergonomic shape theres like a magnet right here between this piece of the bud and the top so it does stick nicely right there you have to worry about that falling off for charging it comes with this little cord right here you know this little cord for charging and then multiple like ear buds rubber ear buds so you can you know get different sizes I put the small ones on because I like those most smaller ears I guess but yeah overall you know if youre looking for a solid pair of wireless earbuds to work out I would highly recommend these again that the JBL Sprints yeah take it easy you",

can pick these up from Amazon theyre currently retailing at 44 pounds whats interesting about these wireless earbuds is they are using bluetooth 50 so youre getting the latest Bluetooth technology which even some of the more expensive headphones arent actually using yep and these come in at a respectable price so Im hoping that the quality of them is pretty good I really like the design and the color of these earphones Im definitely a fan of the cleaner kind of matte stealth look for a lot of tech Im not a fan usually of bright colors so these do really appeal to me you can see they do have a little sticker underneath so make sure you pull these off and get these things charging in my usage I got about two and a half hours of playtime with the earbuds on a full charge you can recharge them between four and five times I got about four charges I took these to the gym with me and I also did some skipping which Ill show you later on the overall design for these earbuds in my short testing seemed pretty robust they fit nice and snugly in the case this is often a problem when Ive used headphones of this nature where they have these little carry cases they say and they often dont fit very tightly and sometimes they dont even charge properly these seem to fit nicely and I didnt have any problems with them not charging the only thing I wasnt too keen on is the LED indicator which indicates the charge status of the earbuds you basically get a blinking system one blink indicates 25 and it then goes up to four theres a little bit of a basic method and its not my favorite way of showing the battery percentage but at least you can tell what charge theyre at of course you also get your micro USB charging cable and some spare earbuds you want to make sure youre wearing the right size so these dont move around and fall out of your ears if youre doing any sort of exercise Ive now got them on charge and you can see theyre sitting in the case and its indicating that theyre almost a fully charged by showing four flashes pairing these earbuds with my phone was probably one of the easiest experiences Ive had with these type of wireless headphones once I removed them from the case they connected to each other and you can see the main earbud starts flashing you then simply connect to the earbuds via bluetooth on your smart phone putting them back into the case turns them off which is really handy the audio quality on these ear pods in my opinion was pretty good with a decent bass and volume level but Im not an audiophile and I dont usually listen to music at really high volumes so please bear this in mind these arent going to compete with really highend earbuds but for me they sounded pretty clear and a good volume with decent bass I also wore these while doing some skipping and they didnt fall out of my ears or move around too much but this is down to choosing the right earbuds so of course they dont fall out of your ears I really like these earbuds and I think therell be my new daily pair Ill definitely be using these at the gym and when Im working out since thats when I most often use them the Bluetooth connectivity for these seemed pretty good I didnt have any issues with cutting out or them losing connection I was also able to walk quite a distance from my phone before I started to lose connection so my overall experience with these earbuds was pretty good they have a really high rating on Amazon so Im not an audiophile as I said but these seem pretty good to my standards so I really hope you enjoyed the video guys if you

Its the first time Im going to introduce you today the prince who opened the package the other day I dont like freelance For the time being Id like to introduce the accessories that are inside This area got off and it was the last opening video but its gone Manual Earpiece mountain size is the main body so it looks like this After all it has a unique shape Speaking of shaved head it has this type of shape Yes this is the feeling of taking the earpiece This is the shape of this circular 2 It s not that straight to your ears because it feels like it s growing like this I dare to follow the shape of the deep ear hole Yes thats right High in the direction of the sea child This is the one that fits in very well Its in the direction of that ear shape Its a bald part because it goes in smoothly This wing part is the ear The fit pan is very comfortable to wear because it gets caught here It makes me feel that it seems that it will not be easy to remove even if it moves because it is excellent in gold It s easy is nt it There is almost no feeling of oppression Music It feels like a completely wireless earphone where there is a fine driving time Well its said that its put in such a small earphone so it wont drive for that long time but this The shaved ys earphone is quite amazing and the driving time is the 5th hour when the book is fully charged If you fully charge this charging case the earphone Since it can be fully charged 3 times it takes 5 hours on the main unit and 10 hours on the battery so its about 15 hours isnt it In the unlikely event that the earphone battery runs out it is possible to charge Kudo for 45 minutes with a charge of 15 minutes It has a quick charge function On the contrary it is a condition that you can keep moving for 45 minutes with just a 15minute break SoundSportfree is a functional aspect that I thought was a little interesting but with its unique acoustic design if the volume is loud it will be ecofriendly to match when the volume is low Even if its a small sound that gives you a powerful sound even if its a loud sound it resonates with 8 thoughts Its an earphone that looks like its hungry Water Its strong against sweat This is true from the front of the boy Even with that ordinary wired earphone its like fluttering its own water I wonder if I can check the durability or go with the water used even if it is not water 8 It will be a person who wants to pass the endurance test a building This is a story this time but this is a big deal It s not waterproof it s not waterproof Just remember that it s resistant to water and sweat Also by using the shaved connect app if you should lose this earphone it will help you to find earphones Its a nice point Im worried that it will be lost because it is small Well such a customer may be relieved if it is linked with this application but maybe it was lost in the prince 4 Yes I was listening to the sound but after all the amulet I dont feel it at all Is this because its an open earphone It is very characteristic that the sound spreads to the left and right and the taste is good with normal canal type earphones and other earphones that allow perfection It has an incredibly natural expanse and it feels very comfortable to wear so what do you call it sports or everyday life Rather than listening to music that life I think that it matches the style of listening to music very much in the room The big one is that there are few low temperatures with other earphones It seems like its not like that and I think there are quite a few customers on the moon but thats why I put it all in Because Im this well Im an opening video At the time when I made the opening video I thought that the origin of this was the strongest Shibamoto Ys Its just a personal personal feeling personal memories Its pretty clear that its already gone I imagine that if they were the ones I would probably put the bestinclass Neucan on it Well then this time it s not a noise canceling model but a sport It was a product with a clearer and more natural sound and a complete sound of 8 seats so dont think of it as shaved  Neucan Please enjoy the shaved earphones with wired earphones However shorts are good Especially in the treble range Naruyoshi Kikuchis bait in South America where I often listen to 8 confirmations of that sound source I also asked Ra and Yaraba Its a very high level earphone That piano Mari feels really good After that saxophone its a degree bass isnt it The low is here The basic high girlylike interaction feels very natural What is often said by that customer is that other complete yl water books Youre talking about not writing with a spear right It s a wish but it s a little big but I do nt think that s the case It s my personal Kiguchi bouvet Zain are here 1 year ago are here Talking about volume control Its not a tap Is this the end There are 3 buttons here Volume up  down and multi in the middle Function buttons Use these three buttons to control the volume and stop playing music This is a bit real isnt it It may take some getting used to because it feels like this I just want to stick to the sound quality while listening to music For those who say is this shaved completely wireless earphone sound sports free wireless Its highly recommended but Im sure its more fun and happy to have the function of ion capture such as the function of Neucan Its a selling point that the skin simply sounds good isnt it Completely you can feel the spread of sound that is rare for us earphones Earphones were introduced to Bose SoundSport Free and we are now preparing 3 colors for you Please choose the color that suits your taste Please select Also you can watch these earphones at each good store Please feel free to sell it to a good bargain near you today Pochan guided us from the Osaka Nihonbashi store Music Hmm 4 minutes", "video_title": "  Bose SoundSport Free wireless headphones", "video_comment_count": "1180",

"collection_date": "20201007 102245937139", "video_id": "CCqRL6cNNlw", "Closed Captions": " alright guys so welcome back to a brand new video todays video were going to be looking at a new pair of over the ear headphones in fact this pair is not even out yet I looked them up online and it doesnt look like they come out until the first part of May but somehow my local target happened to have them so I picked them up so that we can take a look at them for the first time here alright so the pair Im talking about is the JBL live 500 bt now upon the first time that I checked out the box and what you guys may see is it looks a lot like JBL z55 series and to be honest its very similar but there are definitely some improvements and at 150 dollars a very impressive value in this headphones alright so one of the first things that I want to point out since were gonna look and see whats inside the box is the first thing that I notice is for 150 it didnt come with a case not even a pouch and JBL in the past at least had a little drawstring pouch that you can throw the headphones in and at least feel comfortable that you can throw these in a bag without him getting scratched up but these not coming with a case was the first thing I noticed just throw one of those really crappy bags in there just to keep this thing protected and although other than that you do get a micro USB cable for charging again its micro USB and Im still trying to figure out why companies are using these other than the fact that these are in a closet that theyre pulling from to be able to supply this now a huge plus for me is that it comes with the threeandahalf millimeter braided cable most people are not gonna care at this point but I do like the fact that I can use these wired if I want to alright so now we can go right into the headphones the first thing that I do want to point out is that they have 30 hours of battery life and that for 150 is really impressive the build quality on these is actually very similar to the e55 s it has that cloth like material its very similar to the case that comes on the pixel in fact I have the exact same case for my pixel that matches this JBLs branding is right on top there really is no padding on this at all but its not a big deal because this is one of the lightest headphones that youll find especially when it comes to over your headphones now you have a little bit of gloss where it says live right here in the corner now this gloss does pick up fingerprints so this is gonna be something you definitely want to wipe off from time to time you see JBLs logo on the side now the ear cups on these is a pleather material it is very soft its deep enough that your ears are not gonna hit the inside you can see that your left and right are marked inside the ear cups themselves now on the left hand side just by simply pressing and holding you can summons Google assistant or Siri or Alexa and all of those just by doing that now the other good thing is when you have a notification you can simply just tap the side of them and it will read you your notification so thats a huge plus especially if you dont have your phone on you and its on the other side of the room so if youre in a gym you can basically hear all your notifications within the headphones and the other huge advantage even though again without a case I dont know how much it matters these do fold flat and they also fold inwards so that theyre very small now also on the left hand side on the bottom you can see that is where your micro USB port is for charging now these do have the quick charge feature where you can charge these for 15 minutes and get two hours of use and I cant tell you how many times that saves me because I can pick up headphones theyre dead its like damn it but you can plug them in for 15 minutes and then you have two hours which is more than enough to watch most movies or to be able to go to the gym and listen to music for quite a while alright and JBL if youre familiar with them at all they have the switch on the right hand side that if you push it up once itll turn them on and connect them if you havent connected yet just simply push the button up and hold it and itll put it into pairing mode right underneath that you have your volume up and down you have your multifunction button in the middle which if you pressed twice will go skip a track forward you press three times it will go backwards right underneath that is the headphone jack so that if you do want to use these wires you can and then you have your Bluetooth button right here to be able to go to different devices if you have them connected to different devices and then the ambient mode this is another thing thats popular within headphones and they have ambient if you just kind of want to hear your surroundings and then they have a topthree mode so that if somebody comes up to you you can actually carry on a full conversation your music stone really are backwards and the microphones are pulling in vocals very clear I felt like I used that feature a lot it comes in very handy I really dont like having to pull headphones on and off expecially when people come in to talk so that right there is a huge plus durability on these they feel slightly tight so I think over time that will loosen a little bit but that is signs of concern that maybe there is a breaking point in here but I still feel like I can turn these a good bit and not have anything to worry about but now we need to get into sound and to get into sound the first thing I dont want to point out is you definitely want to make sure to download JBLs app JBLs app is giving you control over EQ settings even the talkthrough and ambient mode functions but the EQ settings even though you have your ability to do custom eqs I found that the bass mode was absolutely the best I found that listening to all genres it didnt make anything sound muddy because these headphones are some of the brightest clearest Bluetooth headphones that Ive heard now it does have JBLs like what they call a signature sound and thats where the clarity is boosted but the bass is really tight and punchy I think for 150 dollars Im completely blown away and out of bluetooth headphones thats come out lately this is one of the best pairs that Ive heard in quite a while and I think at 150 it makes it even that more impressive and the sound is just truly incredible the volume is so loud theres no Distortion the soundstage is fairly open it never felt closed in but it definitely didnt feel super wide either but the bass if youre a bass head youre not looking to get like the Skullcandy crushers but the heads shattering bass these are able to do and the tight punchiness that these have its truly amazing how JBL puts out a headphone it feels like theres nothing to it its really light but once theyre on your head as you can see theres a very slim clean looking headphone its not big its not obnoxious it doesnt stick out much I think these headphones could have even been 200 and I would have had no problem recommending these to anybody so the fact that there are a hundred and fifty fifty dollars even the JBL a 55 series you can still see them in stores for 150 this is a huge upgrade in my opinion as far as sound goes and to be able to get the assistant features and be able to hear your text and stuff like that in the headphones theyre giving you better value and not jacking up the price which a lot of companies are doing this days Im not gonna single out any company most of you probably know who Im talking about guys that kind of wraps it up for a hundred and fifty dollars youre getting a pair of headphones that has 30 hours of battery life but youre also getting quick charge feature which again benefits me as I like to just charge a headphone for a few minutes and be able to listen for a couple of hours so thats a huge bonus has premium quality sound across all genres I didnt find a genre that I did not like this with and again vocals the clarity the crispness and the punchiness of the bass this is like the perfect sound signature for me so if youve ever wondered what I look for as far as sound in a headphone this pretty much sums it up but guys thank you so much for checking out this video thank you guys so much for checking out all the other videos and as always guys make sure to stay tuned for more", "video_title": "First Look  JBL Live 500BT Wireless Headphones REVIEW", "video_comment_count": "4010", "video_dislike_count": "530",

were gonna take a look at the sony WF SP 802 Lee Weyer less earbuds that feature digital noise cancellation now you can pick these up on Amazon Ill put a link up in the description the price on these 200 bucks now they come in three different colors you got black blue and orange alright so at the end of this video Im gonna answer three questions number one are these worth 200 bucks number two do they sound better or equal to the Sony m3s and number three where it is ranked at against my top three truly wireless earbuds that have noise cancellation as of right now number one on my list is Sennheiser momentum tools number two so many entries and number three air pop pros alright so lets go to the features real quick you got your Google assistant and your Amazon Alexa builtin now you got extra bass 9 hours worth of battery on a single charge with an additional nine hours using the charging case now you can bump that up if you turn off noise cancellation that is ip55 sweating waterresistant bluetooth technology and you got 360 reality audio lets see anything else now you got fast charge so ten minutes of charge will give you 60 minutes of play time you got to touch controls you do have an app thats available for Android and iOS crystalclear calls alright so you can use this I have to talk on the phone USB typec charging alright so all that for 200 bucks lets see what it is shoutout to white shoes she got the day off yes I get to one deck lets get busy okay now in the side note just in case you wondering whats the major difference between these and the m3s these are waterresistant two entries arent the entries should have better noise cancellation and these should have a better fit than the m3s so these are basically similar but you would get these for the gym now you get the 800 ends for the gym okay lets see what you got inside here now Im gonna try to make this video quick so lets not not beat around the bush giggity all right so we got a nice presentation alert okay Quick Start Guide let me file that these are gonna be your earbuds now like I said this should be more comfortable and easier to wear to the gym than em threes that was one of my biggest gripes with the EM threes they not water resistant so you could take a chance win them to the gym if you want if they get wet you asked out but more importantly they just didnt fit right I think that theyre not too comfortable to work that in and hes got your little wing tips its an extra solve that problem lets see what else you get now this is gonna be your charging case okay so knee Brandon on the top USB typec charging I like that see what else you get now I know thats usual books and plucking the fallen this is gonna be your USB typec charging cable now again I hate these small little cables but it is what it is you get some different size wingtips and some different size earbuds play with those get the right fit got some more usual books and and your 360 degree reality audio music freeze trial plug it in follow all right now for just size comparison lets grab the m3s thats what I was talking about you see what the entries theres no wing or knees and these have that oval that oval shape so now with the 800 ends you got the wing on the back so thats gonna lock into your ear so when youre doing your back flips in the gym theyre not gonna fall out alright so let me pause the video Ill grab our phone were pair these up matter of fact lets all drop these in the case first get this initial charge going on started gonna look just like that alright so let me grab a phone were pair these up and well start our usual testing talk amongst yourselves alright Jos will be back in now before we start our usual testing guess who showed up for work late what great ladies and gentlemen white shoes is back in the building white shoes calm down alright so the first thing we want to test is the magnets in the charging case so Im gonna start off with minimum shaking okay no movement lets increase the intermediate shake edge okay a little bit of movement maximum shake egde rah rah rah rah okay so these are the five intermediate shake j so basically the magnets are pretty strong alright so the first thing you want to do is pair up your headphones now once you take them out the case theyll automatically be in bluetooth pairing mode go to your phones bluetooth menu and select the 800 ends the next thing you want to do is download the Sony headphones app now once you open this up and connect to your phones this will give you full access to all of the features so lets run through those real quick got the name of the headphones you got your battery percentage for the left the right and the case you got a power button so you can turn them on and off and you got your tutorial your version notifications and information you can launch your music control center about and help now this is the status tab so if you want you can have adaptive sound control on or off now if you turn that on basically what that does is right now Im sitting in a quiet environment if I happen to walk outside and I have adaptive sound control on itll automatically turn on noise cancellation then when I get back to where its quiet itll automatically turn it off alright so were gonna leave that off got the song you got playing pause and you got your volume controls next well take it over to the sound tab now you can turn on ambient sound control Im wearing the headphones right now I got Ambika sound sound turned on and I can hear my voice perfectly clear but if you want to you can lower that and have more of your music playing or increase it and have more of your voice you got an equalizer which you can set from speech to manual you got to customs you can turn it off you got bright excited mellow relaxed vocal troubles and my favorite bass boost now you got to 360 degree reality audio setup Im leave that off because on the side note that only works for certain apps and I dont use those apps now you got to sound quality mode so you can have a priority for sound or priority for stable connection well leave a percent take it over the systems now if you want to you can change your touch controls so right now for the left I got ambient sound but if you want to you can have playback volume Google assistant Amazon Alexa or just turn it off got automatic power alright so well leave that off well leave that on this way save some battery pauses when the headphones turn off leave that on got your notifications automatic download software thats pretty much it alright so now lets talk about the fit and this is what separates these from the Sony entries the fit on these is super comfortable but most importantly they do not move at all so this would be perfect for the gym matter of fact lets do the head shake test Im gonna start off at minimum shake edge no movement at all lets go to intermediate shake edge okay no movement and now maximum shake egde huh okay almost passed out but they didnt move one inch heres how theyre gonna look when you wearing them hide shadow to the corona fro we still growing it no movement at all perfect for the gym now lets do a sound test all right so I got a classic queued up young lover are we going to switch it up today Im gonna start off with max volume the EQ set the bass boost and noise cancellation turned on alright so one type of playing boys I promise now Im not gonna sing bird bad hands rub them together lets get it on okay woo for 18 and over Oh for 18 in over no I lets go girl wont you go go home to your mama your mama go home to your papa your Papa you too young to be my lover to be thin it lover Oh you must be 18 in over are you hold up let me let this rock oh my god I hold up once Apple play a pause yeah yeah ladies and gentlemen Sony has done it again all right Sony has done it again these sound incredible if you heard this only em threes you know what to expect I play with that EQ for yourself but when the bass dropped on knees and I havent even tried my official music yet these sound incredible all right now let me test out a few different songs and well get back in alright now I just tested these out with a bunch of different songs from a bunch of different artists and I got to be honest with yall on a scale of 1 to 10 the Sony WF SP 800 ends our major major major go and at 200 bucks as Bob Barker would say the price is right now Ive been searching for the longest to find a set of headphones that could take the place on my power beats pros at the gym ladies and gentlemen I just found them not only do these stay in my ears just like the power beats now you see the power beats got that wing these have the wing theyre not gonna move around in your ears but you got digital noise cancellation youve got a fully functional app and these sound better and Im keeping a rebel child these sound incredible its over for the power beats pros lets do the rest of our testing all right so first lets do the reconnection test how long did it take to reconnect to your phone after you take them off and put them in a charging case alright so I got the music playing lets take these out drop them in the case close them up fully disconnect it take them back out one one thousand two one thousand three one thousand four one thousand just connected so between four and five 1000 thats pretty good alright so now lets do the one ear bud chest can you play music from one ear bud while the other one is charging up in the case lets hit play okay so Im going to take out the right side drop it in the case close it up lets hit play okay the left side of still playing lets put the right side back in wait for it to reconnect ok just reconnect it now Im going to take the left side out drop it in the case lets hit play the right side is still playing ladies and gentlemen you could play music from either earbud while the other one is charging in the case thats a win alright so now lets do the range test Im gonna walk all the way to 50 feet and lets see if theres any drop connection I said lets hit playing the music alright we start walking forty feet Music Im coming back in five all right lets hit pause okay so I walk all the way to 50 feet no drop connection at all all right so now lets check the touch controls one tap on the right side for playing pause okay no problems with that double tap to skip to the next song okay thats fine triple tap to reverse okay that works and long press for your voice assistant whats the weather for tomorrow okay no problems are dead now for the left ear bud one tap to turn on noise cancellation okay now that does have a voice prompt now another tap to turn on ambient sound mode okay now Im in ambient sound mode my voice is crystal clear I can hear everything around me and if youve long press on the left ear bud thats quick attention mode so say you got your music on and you just wanna have a quick conversation without turning on ambient sound mode just press it and hold it and Ill mute your music and increase your voice so all that a touch controls work alright so now lets check for lag latency and what I mean by that is when watching a video is there any delay from the persons lips to what you hear okay no delay at all so this would be perfect for watching your videos perfectly watching your movies alright so now lets check the call quality all right of course Im download Amaya its ringing out of both is your yo your voice sounds mad loud how do I sound sounds clear this sounds the best that Ive ever sounded even better than my ear pods guess what headphones Im using guess what headphones Im using right now these new ones called the air power threes they made a today they never even came out yet now Im just kidding Im just kidding I know I know I know you use getting my height the fake joint set the flare pods oh my chill chill dont blow me up man I got a few fakes on deck though yeah I got I got a set with your name on it though I know I know what what you doing oh you got a barbecue whats up with the soap with some of the social distancing yeah well Im saying if yall dont care no morning whats up Im coming to let me get a hot dog yo what up let me get a burger you know if nobody dont care no more let me get a plate thats all Im saying yeah if coronavirus is going I wanna play I know Im a fat ass uhoh let me call you back in the midnight let me wrap this up Im gonna call you back if I gotta tell you I gotta tell you some some juicy T alright alright good bye all right now yo I gotta say one thing the volume on knees you know the volume is mad loud this is one time I might have to turn these down talking on the phone with these the volume was super loud and clear so I like these Im definitely feeling these were talking on the phone all right so now let me answer those three questions number one are these worth 200 bucks and the answer is yes not only yes hell yes worth every penny number two how did hes ranked against the Sony M well in terms of sound quality they pretty much sound the same but when it comes to noise cancellation the M theories cancel out more noise so if youre looking for a set thats gonna cancel the most amount of noise you got to go with the M threes the noise cancellation is a little bit better but sound quality wise as far as music they pretty much sound the same and ambient sound mode pretty much sounds the same and number three where do these drink at and my top three truly wireless earbuds with noise cancellation and as of right now they didnt make the cut number one on my list and still assign houses all right these cancels out a lot of noise but they sound incredible number two sony m threes cancel out a lot of noise they sound incredible at number three and pop pros now you can say whatever you want about the air pods these cancel out a lot of noise and they sound incredible lets wrap this up alright so overall on a scale of one to ten the Sony WF SP 800 aims are a major major major go and like I said for 200 bucks the price is right Im definitely sold on these the fit is excellent so now you could rock these to the gym they not gonna fall out plus the ip55 sweat and water resistant you got nine hours worth of battery on a single charge plus nine hours with the case and quick charge ten minutes of charge will give you one hour at the play time thats pretty dope the ambient sound mode works perfectly as far as noise cancellation it does cancel out a lot of noise not the best on the market but it does work out you are getting noise cancellation your music is gonna sound great no lag when you watching the videos you can use these one at a time while the other one is charging up in the case so thats gonna double your battery life the phone call sounded pretty good and super loud but most importantly the sound quality on these is gonna blow you away trust me when I tell you make sure you download the app and play with the EQ settings for yourself the EQ is the game changer on these I trust me these sound incredible anyway hit me up in

"collection_date": "20201007 102245937188", "video_id": "AMl4dsiXhlA", "Closed Captions": " whats up guys Im Jeff Rizal dizzle better known as Jeffrey the jet better known as mr Marathon now that Ive run a marathon when I proposed to Amelia anyways thats not why were here although its partially why were here were gonna talk about the best headphones in earbuds for running so I havent done this video I dont think in a long time if ever but Ive obviously tested so many different pairs of headphones and earbuds out there true Wireless regular Wireless this brand that brand that I have a good idea of what my opinion is for what are the best ones like obviously youre buying one so which one should you get now if you enjoy the video in your new smash that thumbs up button run all over that thumbs up button you see what I there we money yeah thats right okay subscribe lets get to it Music all right so what makes headphones good for running well theres a couple of things right so the first thing is probably just comfort youre gonna be using them for extended period of time probably 30 minutes to like a couple hours so you want them to be really comfortable now that is subjective but you know Ive tried out so many that I think I have a good idea of whats gonna work for most people out there so comfort is one thing the other thing is a secure fit so you dont want them bobbling around you you want to secure fit to where you never feel like theyre gonna pop out or work their way out of your ears so just as an example I tried out what I they be the SOL Republic amps air 2 and I love those true wireless earbuds like theyre some of my favorite they have amazing audio quality but they dont do a great job of locking in your ear so over time they work their way out you dont want that with running headphones you also want a good cable management system so if you dont get true Wireless you dont want that cable hanging around all over the place you want some sort of cinch or cord or some sort of ability to make that cable a nonfactor youve want probably pretty good audio quality although I think thats of lesser importance because most of them are pretty passable one thing that I think a lot of people overlook is clicky and tactile buttons I cant tell you how many pairs of headphones and earbuds Ive tried out that have like touch capacitive buttons and they might be fine for at the office but when youre running you need something that when your fingers are sweaty and youre on the fly you can easily make those adjustments to volume track management pause play etc they have to have a decent microphone for if youre gonna take halls and they have to have some sort of waterproofing rating theyre not to be ipx7 certified so they dont need to be completely waterproof but you dont want them to break if you sweat a lot you also want a decent Bluetooth connection now if you dont have a good Bluetooth connection youre gonna get all sorts of crinkles and cracks and interferences with a signal I know that used to happen to me a lot like years and years ago if you have that with your current earbuds thats a sign you may want to upgrade because if like little body parts if an arm gets in the way and it cuts out the signal that is not gonna be tolerable so just a couple of things obviously a ton of headphones check that and and fit that bill these are my three favorites lets start off with what I would consider the overall true Wireless and this probably comes as no surprise because Ive covered them a lot on this channel they are the Jabra Ally active 65 Ts so I love the standard 65 T comfortable fit really nice design they have an adjustable EQ settings within the mobile app they even have something now I would consider an xfactor feature so great sound isolation passive sound isolation I made that mistake in the past passive sound isolation but they have a here through setting that allows in sound from around you so if youre running in an urban environment or just anywhere that you want to be able to hear things around you thats something that you may utilize and a lot of earbuds dont have a hear through settings so I really appreciate that about 65 Ts they also have solid battery life so five hours on a single charge pretty good considering the size of these true wireless earbuds and then an extra 10 hours in the charged case if youre running a marathon 5 hours should be probably long enough for you I think most people will be good with the battery life and if you factor in the case is good as well now they are also IP 56 certified which is water and sweat resistant but you you cant submerge them I dont think you have any problems with the waterproofing if I could only choose one true wireless earbuds for running I would probably go with the 65 t just a solid secure fit and they check a heck of a lot of boxes now an alternative to them would be the J lab epic air elite so they had the J lab epic airs which I liked but the epic air elite are much better they have a very secure fit the only thing I dont like and the reason they didnt make the list is I dont love their touch capacitive sensors but there are a nice alternative of the 65 Ts now my budget pick I think are gonna surprise some people so Ive kind of in the last like couple of weeks been on a quest to find are there any good cheap wireless earbuds that would be good for running the short answer is there are some not many theres a ton of knockoff headphones on Amazon as you probably know and I settled upon the elects comm I think theyre just called the Bluetooth earbuds I dont even know if they have a model number now Ive seen probably twenty other pairs of earbuds that look exactly identical to these I mean completely almost exactly the same buttons everything but what I appreciate about these is a couple of things number one the price is really low like 20 or under typically thats a little bit more affordable than the other ones and Ive noticed that their buttons are somehow a little bit more clicky so the volume buttons on the top SS track management buttons and theyre very clicky and tactile they have a nice pause play button on the side but most importantly a very very very secure fit they almost fit like the the Beats powerbeats 3 but maybe just slightly less secure and a way more affordable they also are ipx7 certified a submergible down to a meter for a minute a couple of things I dont like though one is the microphone is a little far away from your mouth because its builtin so when you go to talk on the phone its not gonna be your favorite but I think that is actually a little bit better than having the remote in line because then theres a symmetry then the cable isnt heavier on one side than as the other and they come with the cinch which I know isnt a big deal but they do a really good job of kind of keeping that cable out of your way you can either wear them you know down youre tucking down your shirt this way or down the back I think for 20 dollars theyre probably the best budget headphones that you can get for running now me personally my favorite running earbuds if I could only have one would be the jbird X threes now I know I sound like a broken record because subscribers I mean Ive been using these for out probably going on three years I love them theyre affordable they come with foam ear tips so they have great sound isolation in a very comfortable fit and you can wear them in two ways right under ear or you can wrap them around your ear and almost get like a true wireless experience thats part of the reason I selected them because the cable is completely out of your way and it dangles I guess against the the back of your head here and that means that you dont even notice its there its almost like using true wireless earbuds but you still have the remote that you can use and theyre a lot more affordable and they are water and sweat resistant and you can adjust the EQ settings within that jbert app you want more bass you can do that you want more mids you like listening in a classical or country music or something you can make that adjustment within the jbert app I just I dont know Ive tested so many types of earbuds I just keep gravitating to these because they are so versatile and they do so many things for you and now that theyre a little bit older theyre really really affordable now a newer alternative to the X 3s and the ones that I find myself using the second most would be the jbird Terra Pro Soutar Pro a little bit more expensive I think theyre like 160 bucks right in around there and they dont completely eliminate the cable but they have a pretty good system they come with a braided cable the one thing that I really like about them though is they have this switch fit system so you can rotate the actual earbuds themselves to more quickly switch from under ear to around the ear and so if you want new running earbuds ones that came out recently Id go probably with the Terra Pro Im such a value hunter though I think I would probably just stick with the X 3s I love them I mean I I love the tarah pro 2 I just maybe gravitate more towards the x3 so Ill link all of these in the description and one thing I forgot to mention is our website and mobile app so for anybody thats new we look for deals every single day we have a full time person that does this and they find amazing deals on jaybird bose JBL pretty much any big name brand you know about and they post about it on our website and our free iOS and Android mobile

"F41GUfWsKi8", "Closed Captions": " hello guys in todays video were going to check out the top 5 best budget wireless headphones in 2019 I made this list based on my personal opinion and I try to list them based on their price quality durability and more to find out more information about these budget wireless headphones you can check out the description below if youd like to win one of these products make sure you watch the whole video click the like button and comment the hidden word found in this video at number 5 its the jab remove shopping on a budget is pretty hard because of lacking funds well simply being frugal is hard because most of the tech pieces these days can be quite expensive however with just a bit of research on the value of the product you can get plenty of options especially in the wireless headphone market one of the most notable options comes from the Danish manufacturer Jabra the move is a perfect pair of wireless headphones for the outdoorsy with their excellent design lightweight body great sound decent battery life and seamless connectivity Joe Burrus quality is also playing a part and you wont have to worry about that the Jabra move sport a pretty interesting and attractive design thats excellent for sports but not just that it has a pretty minimalistic that I catch in design with its mesh fabric headband thats dust resistant perforated and padded making it comfortable the whole device weighs just 150 grams which is excellent despite having stainless steel construction that connects the headband and ear cups it offers plenty durability and flexibility at the same time the device is available in multiple paint jobs such as navy black beige cobalt blue and red all of them are ultra gorgeous and you can choose the one that suits your style foremost theres no dedicated ear cup for each ear and it doesnt affect the sound performance just the controls will be switched here at the site all the controls are on the ear cups theres a power switch that acts as a Bluetooth button and the microUSB port for charging on the other side youll spot the 35 millimeter audio port for passive use and a bunch of playback buttons that are essential and are extremely intuitive the jab remove isnt just a pretty face they deliver plenty of performance from their price point too the county has equipped this headset with a DSP that delivers appropriate bass response clear mids and sharp highs which was surprising to see in the budget scene to get the best sound though you need to get a perfect seal as the sound leakage is a large issue with the move the battery life is pretty adequate of eight hours of playback time a Bluetooth 40 delivers excellent connectivity even an extended range the best pair of budget headphones for active people at number four its the empower Oh 59 if you want a pair of very cheap headphones you would guess that you have to sacrifice a lot and in the majority of cases that would be true except in the empower Oh 59 these headphones are affordable the most affordable in this budget list but they deliver plenty of qualities to make them disabled or at least capable of functioning as a good pair of wireless headphones they deliver a solid and comfortable fit good quality build interesting design strong connectivity and loud sound in the budget package if you look closely at the design of the empower 59 youll notice that they resemble the beats by dr dre headphones with a teardrop shape outer part that connects the ear cups to the headband they come available in multiple paint jobs like black and red black deep black and green black and gray black and blue light silver pink and rose gold all of which look excellent and deliver some flashy aesthetics when you take them in your hand please dont feel like a quality pair of headphones however theyll do a great job of hanging around for years to come weighing just under 11 ounces these headphones are incredibly light making them a pleasure to use they also use faux leather to cover the ear pads that are paneled with memory foam to deliver comfort not the best leather and memory foam in the market but they provide some nice comfort the headband is also pretty comfortable thanks to its slight memory foam padding and a faux leather cladding the controls are pretty impressive as theyre located on the right ear cap which consists of the playback controls power button which is also the pairing button and the volume buttons thanks to its 41 Bluetooth connectivity you get a seamless connection and it delivers a pretty long range of about 30 feet without any lag or corruption the sound quality is made possible thanks to the pair of 14 millimeter drivers that are located on each ear cup which can get pretty loud but dont expect the best sound quality then again for their price the sound performance was pretty good with emphasized bass decent mids just decent combined with the excellent battery life of 20 hours the M power Oh 5 9 is a dream come true for the budget buyers at number 3 its the JBL t 450 bt if you want to find something in the middle of the budget range id suggest the JBL t 450 bt we always expect good quality and sound performance from a tried and proven company like JBL and these are no disappointment theyre extremely affordable and deliver plenty of value for their price like decent sound easytouse controls and excellent connectivity to complete the package the JBL T 450 BTS have a very interesting but understated and compact design at the same time and Im quite pleased with it they come in three paint jobs that make it suitable for everybody black blue and white while I would recommend the black and blue versions for commuters the blue model is perfect for the gym or for your morning run thanks to its predominant plastic build these headphones are very light and the plastic looks pretty good however they feel a little flimsy to the touch theres no padding on the headband but there is plenty on the ear cups making these on ear headphones very comfortable however for users that want to use them for longer periods of time the lack of pounding on the headband may cause some problems the controls of the headset are very basic and utilitarian but they get the job done and its worth mentioning that theyre located on the right ear cap the wireless connectivity of these headphones is excellent as they pair instantly with your device and a connection stay strong up to 33 feet of distance theyre equipped with Bluetooth 40 technology for the purpose and the battery life is good enough at 11 hours and it takes about three hours to recharge them which is not ideal the sound performance of the JBL T 450 BT is pretty standard JBL with dominant bass and balanced mids the treble is good but lacks some liveliness overall I can say that these have some quality sound but balanced and they can get pretty loud with these headphones JBL house delivered a solid option for budget buyers at number two its the taotronics bh o full row the chinese brand tout Ronix has delivered some interesting headphones in the last few years although the meaning hits in the budget range are safe delivered plenty of desirable qualities and features without asking for a high price the taotronics ph o 4 o is one of their most notable models delivering excellent wireless performance noise canceling technology great sound comfort and looks all in an affordable package lets look at what else these headphones have to offer the company has made quite a name for itself with its premium looking designs and the ph o full row is no different it adopts the looks of highend headphones like the sony wh 1000 x m3 or the post quiet comfort 35 3 which most of the users prefer they look quite good to be honest and dont look cheap at all the aluminium ring on the outer part of the ear cups just enhances its premium claim theyre pretty thickly padded on the ear cups and on the headband delivering excellent comfort and are very lightweight for their size the clamping force is perfect as well to round off the package the controls are pretty intuitively placed and they deliver plenty of quality as well they consist of the basic playback buttons power button volume buttons and the anc control button this particular model is equipped to the wide range of features like the integrated microphone that allows you to take high quality calls the pairing is made possible by the Bluetooth 40 technology and its very stable the ANC is very good as well doing a good job of blocking outside noise but not superb and the battery life is excellent at about 30 hours with the ANC off despite being a budget pair of headphones the taotronics bh0 road delivers great quality sound thats pretty warm and pleasant to listen to while they wont please an audiophile theyll deliver a good musical experience with no harshness in the highs and no overpowering bass the mids were pretty clear and balanced and overall you can listen to them without any problem at number one its the tribe it x3 tune the tribe it x3 tune is an excellent of headphones and theyre definitely the best pair of budget wireless headphones in the market for a variety of reasons they boast an excellent design good build quality amazing comfort levels great wireless performance and best of all they have great sound quality that can compete with more expensive headphones like most of the budget headphones in the market the tribe it x3 tune rocks are pretty basic and utilitarian design but it does it so well it has an allblack design with the ear cups attached to the plastic headband and unlike most budget headphones they fold inwards for convenient storage in the included storage case which impressed me the headband has a pretty good feeling to it and it had some cushioning for comfort the ear cups are decorated with a grill giving them an open end look and they have the Tri bit logo on them as well on the left ear camp youll find the 35 millimeter audio port for passive use and on the right hand side the power button volume controls playback controls and the microUSB port for charging the comfort levels on the Tri bit exfree tune are pretty excellent as the faux leather ear cups have plenty of cushioning in them perfect for office use and long listening sessions however due to their excellent seal they werent breathable enough the wireless connection is pretty much perfect and strong and whole device was very easy to use and control the sound quality of these headphones is amazing considering their price with a pretty warmer soundscape that was pleasing however if youre used to listening from high fidelity headphones youll find these lacking the pair of 40 millimeter drivers deliver plenty of clarity in the mids the treble was pretty aggressive but not annoying and the bass was warm but punchy the perfect pair of budget wireless headphones you cant get any better than this thanks for watching I hope you liked the video if you found it helpful please remember to leave a like and subscribe to my channel to see more videos like this in the future if

and more to find out more information about these wireless headphones you can check out the description below if youd like to win one of these products make sure you watch the whole video click the like button and comment the hidden word found in this video at number 5 its the Sennheiser PXE 550 the German audio manufacturing giant Sennheiser is known for its high fidelity headphones that have set industry standards for many years their interpretation of the wireless headphone dedicated for travellers and commuters with its excellent active noise cancellation the Sennheiser px II 550 has been nearperfect it has the trademark Sennheiser sound quality and tons of other features and its premium price but its all worth it for this great wireless headset the countys earlier efforts to make a wireless noise cancelling headphone have been a disaster but with the PSC 550 things have changed designwise these headphones have adopted a simpler and more streamlined look compared to its predecessors with the buttons having a softer look and not catching attention the ear cups have an oval shape which is a little strange but they sit comfortably around your ears with great comfort speaking about comfort the Sennheiser pxc 550 delivers with an inch thick padding on the ear caps covered with a soft faux breathable leather which provides much needed comfort for commuters and travelers that have long flights the active noise cancellation on these headphones is very refined with three modes one is full noise cancellation the second is off and the third is the one that adapts the ambient noise giving you the appropriate level for your surroundings from the cap tune smartphone app you can set your own custom sound profiles complete with EQ DSP effects and levels of a and C another interesting feature of these was the touch sensitive right ear cup that are some interesting commands and controls for playback and cool the sound performance of the PXE 550 was just perfect excellently balanced with a dose of fun rather than the complete clean analytical sound of the normal Sennheisers the soundstage was exceptionally big despite being closed back wireless headphones these were amazing and one of the best for listening to music I noticed it had a perfect performance with every genre Anna was quite impressed with its performance with movies and podcasts what are the best headphones for frequent travelers and commuters at number four its the Bose QuietComfort 35  the Bose QuietComfort 35  is one of the best wireless headphones in the market for quite some years now its not surprising as to why this product is so popular because its the most comfortable headset on the market as its name implies and with great our seeming style amazing sound great connectivity and one of the best noise cancelling features its a catch designwise bose has chosen their really simple and utilitarian design for the quiet comfort 35 to that weve come to know from the company for years now I could say that the headphones have a pretty neutral design and theyre appropriate for any setting that anyone can wear them comfortably they have an all plastic build without any flash or striking details and one might assume that the quality is below par but these will take plenty of beating before giving up thanks to the quality and sturdy construction they wages 234 grams which is very surprising for the size and Wireless nature and theyre the lightest premium wireless model and the most comfortable pair of headphones that Ive ever put around my ears with a perfect clamping force and plush padding the active noise cancellation is one of the best in the market as well and now you can adjust it via the smartphone app to low full or completely off the battery life of these headphones is about 20 hours with the noise cancellation at full and on top of that the features consist of the Google assistance which has its dedicated button and works excellently unlike other headphones the post QuietComfort 35 2 s anc works perfectly and consistently at tuning down engine and crowd noises but its not as capable with highfrequency noises the sound performance of the Bose QuietComfort 35 2 is amazing delivering a wide soundstage that was surprising considering its closed back I like the base which was adequate unlike other boats models with overpowering bases the mids were clean and detailed and highs were sharp enough I would describe the sound as warm and smooth adequate for the masses at number three its the vmoda crossfade to the vmoda crossfade to may not be as famous as other names on this list but once you try them theres no going back delivering amazing highquality wireless headphones and the definite best sound that youll find in this category it sports a decent battery life and the best wireless connectivity that you can find and on top of that they have an interesting design durable and quality build that will last you a lifetime so lets take a closer look at this headset if youve seen its predecessor you would instantly recognize that its a V mode a headset as it rocks the same iconic design with a few changes it is slightly smaller ear cups than its predecessors but the fit is exceptionally good and aesthetically these look amazing unfortunately they arent as comfortable as the aforementioned bose which are industry leaders in that area but theyre not far behind theyre equipped with nice memory foam and I could comfortably use them as my goto headphone on top of all this if you go to the manufacturers website you can customize them to your liking to suit your style and taste one of the biggest selling points of these headphones is the new apt X Bluetooth support which is the highest quality streaming codec you can get the battery life of the vmoda Crossway  is a little behind its competitors rated and about 14 hours between charges but these are not exactly commuter or traveller headphones in the package you get a nice semi hard carrying case and a stylish orange cable for Wired use when your battery runs out the motor was a brand that was known for its overpowering bass head style soundscape however the crossfade twos are balanced and natural perfect for every genre they can deliver some punchy low and subbase when its needed though I was particularly impressed with their amazing soundstage which was three dimensional and their textured and detailed midrange overall the sound is extremely rich and detailed and it boasts amazing near analytical clarity if you want the best sound and connectivity youd be hardpressed to go against the crossfade to at number two its the Beats Studio three Beats headphones are one of the most iconic and most popular pieces of tech accessories you may see since their introduction theyve amassed a huge following fanbase and since then its been an absolute craze first owned by monster now theyre an Apple subsidiary but they still keep their own identity and breathtaking design especially the studio three apart from that they are extremely comfortable great sound noise cancellation and they fit right in with the iPhone users despite being owned by Apple the Beats Studio 3 has not opted for the minimalistic and streamlined trademark Apple design theyve gone with our iconic street style design thats given them their fame theyre a little sleeker and more refined than the original beats produced by monster with an all plastic build and the pizza logo on each ear cap you can get these headphones in different colors porcelain rose shadow gray blue white and my personal favorite matte black which has some urban stealthy look to it the company has marketed the Beats Studio 3 is one of the most comfortable in the market and they dont disappoint thats mostly due to the lightweight plastic construction but the foam ear cushions that are large and fit every head size do their part as well in terms of features the Beats Studio 3 doesnt have tons of them or any fancy new tech however it does the basics exceptionally well its equipped with a fast fuel technology that provides 3 hours of playback time in about 10 minutes of charging perfect for commuters that are always in a rush its equipped with Apples w1 chip that delivers about 22 hours of playback time with the active noisecancelling on however it achieves this only with Apple devices it manages about half of that with Android devices with a great soundscape designed for the masses great battery life and perfect performance for Apple users the Beats Studio 3 is one of the best headphones in the market and that number one its the Sony WH 1000x m3 first off I want to say that no other headphone can achieve the excellence of the Sony WH 1000x m3 and I dont see it happening for at least a few years it improves on its already excellent predecessor with some design touches and enhanced technologies it the best combination of features that are very cleverly implemented such as the delicious sound and perfect noise cancellation for starters the Sony WH 1000 X m3 has not changed a lot from its predecessor but some slight tweaks make it a masterpiece you can get it in one of two tasteful color schemes the dark black and the platinum silver one of the biggest improvements comes to the headband which bends naturally and gives a closer fit looking professional and streamlined on your head the comfort is top of the class as well and you can wear these for hours without feeling any kind of strain these headphones sport Sonys HD noise canceling processor qn1 that manages to block mid and high frequency sounds that other manufacturers with pay NC lack the QN one also improves the audio performance of the device by handling 32bit signal processing the battery life of these headphones is about 30 hours even with the NC activated and its quick charge feature is perfect delivering five hours of play time in just 10 minutes of charging I was extremely impressed with the touch sensitive right ear camp which was pretty responsive accurate and easy to learn its coolest feature was the quick attention mode when you hold your palm over the ear cup and music and noise cancelling is turned off to listen to outside noises the clean and refined sound of these headphones comes from the analog amplifier delivering excellent instrumentals and vocals with a punchy and aggressive low range clear and neutral mids and sharply detailed highs you can switch from genre to genre and still get a perfect experience providing the best noise cancellation and increased comfort with high quality sound itll become your best friend excelling in every category these are the best headphones that money can buy in 2019 thanks for

alright they definitely feels lightweight and comfortable Im shaking my hand around right now theyre not moving around I can easily see myself working out with these on take it over to the music max volume whoo alright I gotta stand up because this is my song about to get height no doubt indeed where that weed if yall know the words sing along lets go that old real lets go theres a war going on outside no man is safe from you can run but you cant hide forever from these streets that we dont took you walking with your head down scared to look you shook cuz aint no such things as halfway krunks they never around when the beef cooks am I part of town its similar to Vietnam now we all grown up and all and beyond the cops control they better had a riot get ready try to bang me and get rocksteady bottom AK one double I touch you and leave you with not much to go home with my skin is thick cuz Ill be up in the mix of action if Im not a home puffing live relaxing lets go Turks hey let me calm down all right calm down calm down oh yeah every for yourself lets see the play and pause button works alright playing pause works cool I was getting a little workout just now on a scale of 1 to 10 Im definitely feeling these so far now I gotta take them to the gym and put them to the test were gonna test that out talk through technology when people try to talk to you see if you could talk without taking the headphones off were gonna try all that stuff out ice Ill be back Im gonna run to the gym before they close talk amongst yourselves all right Joss well be back in now just came back from the gym I did a full savage workout and Im ready to let yall know what I think about these headphones on a scale of 1 to 10 these are a major major major go Im feeling these headphones and theyre definitely my new favorites for the gym now up until today Ive been cycling through three sets of overtheair headphones at the gym have my sole joints yall remember these had the SMS headphones and another set of soul headphones now all the radius headphones have something in common with the project rock editions thats the sweat proof air cups thats the main difference between regular headphones and gym headphones sweat proof air cups you can take any set of headphones and rock them in the gym but youre gonna have problems with the sweat perfect example my skull candy crush your wireless now I rock these in the gym when Im doing heavy weights but the main problem with these if I rock them today and Im gonna go to the gym tomorrow when I pull them out my bag they still gonna be moist and wet and slimy and I dont know about you but theres nothing worse than pulling your headphones out the bag and they still wet from the previous workout thats pretty disgusting and I dont flow like that now theres 10 things that I want to cover with the project Rock additions so lets break it down number one the price 250 bucks The Price is Right thats right on Paul with all the other gym headphones but these sounds incredible now if I had to compare the sound against these three sets of headphones its no contest these are official JBL headphones youve got a lot of bass nice and crystal clear sound Im not gonna complain about the price at all number two the look how do these headphones look they definitely look like a set of gym headphones now when you up in the gym you dont want sleek stylish spaceage headphones you want some rugged manly looking headphones look at these you got that Texas Longhorns symbol on it a bow these just look rugged they feel rugged beautiful look on these I these are real man headphones let me show you what they look like on head now I was up in the gym I took a few snapshots I said thats what you dont look like when youre rocking them and this is me rocking them down the side note suns out guns out lets go all right lets keep it moving number three build quality now these are plastic built headphones right so nothing to write home about but they feel good they dont feel like cheap plastic they feel nice and lightweight now let me tell you something when I was rocking these headphones another difference between regular headphones and gym headphones is the grip these have a nice set of grip on these ear cups now if youre doing bench press this happens to me all the time when Im rocking my school candy crush your wireless if you dont have this kind of spongy grip to it once you start sweating these headphones move around on your head so when youre laying flat on the bench youre gonna have to put the headphones up like this otherwise soon as you start benching they start slipping off and sliding backwards now I was doing heavy chest bench press today these didnt move at all I didnt have to adjust them up like this I left them regular and they stayed still so Im definitely feeling it alright so build quality a 1 number for the field how do they feel are they comfortable or not these are super lightweight I rock them the whole time I was in the gym I didnt have to adjust my ears fellas if you rock an ear ring theyre not gonna press against your earring its not gonna hurt at all nice and light weight no complaints with debt number five battery life now Im gonna have to get back to yall maybe in a couple of days when I do a whats in my gym bag but if these work as they advertised 16 hours worth of battery life thats a major go all right youre not working out 16 hours a week and 5 minute charge give you one hour worth of battery life thats a go I but well get back to that but like I said if it works as advertised nothing complain about number 6 phone calls now I tested this out when I was up in the gym I had to call the 24hour diner and see what time they closed Im up in the gym its a lot of background noise I heard the person crystal clear they heard me phone calls on this as ago so if youre rocking these headphones and you get a phone call youre not gonna have to take them off and switch or take them off and hold the phone in your hand and have all that sweat going on your phone just leave them on answer the phone call number 7 talk through technology now on the low that might be the best feature of these headphones and thats another reason why I said it worth the price talk through technology now let me show you how that works now when I was unboxing it I didnt even notice that this is an actual button right here you got a little click on it so basically when youre in the gym and youre listening to music and somebody comes and taps you on the shoulder and you want to start up a little conversation you dont have to take your headphones off once you press that button basically its not gonna mute the song but the song is basically just gonna fade away you hear it a little bit and youre gonna hear these noisecanceling mics open up so it sounds like its amplifying the sound its hard to explain that over video you dont have to put these on here and for yourself when I test them testing them out a couple of times I took the red one plus with me to the gym and I know a lot of people is gonna ask me to see it so I kept taking it out you know flashing it and people kept coming up to me I was having conversations pressing the button and everybody knew I was testing these headphones so I was like talk to me and people are talking to me Id have to take them off at all my gym is super noisy the music is mad loud I was having regular conversations so to talk through technology that might be the best feature of these headphones number eight wired connection now you use these wired it sounds pretty much exactly the same but the good thing is even if your batterys dead you can plug in the wire and still use the headphone now certain headphones Im not gonna name any names but certain headphones if the battery is completely dead you cant use them beats excuse me something in the to these you can rock them with dead battery all right so you forget to charge them up you get to the gym your workout is not done just plug them in unless you got an iPhone you better have that dongle on deck next the case alright this is number nine the case this case is dope its a hardshell case if you notice ass holes in the top its ventilated alright so basically what that means is once you finish working out and you sweating all over the place you put your headphones back in the case theyre gonna be able to drive because they have ventilation in it now usually what I do is if I sweat too much Ill just leave these out all of my other headphones basically the same thing you just leave them out three hours later theyll be dry so by the time its your next workout youre not gonna have to worry about that last but not least number ten the sound how do these headphones sound and they sound amazing now not as much base as the Skullcandy crutches of course not you really cant find headphones with this kind of bass because this is hectic feedback bass so these are the headphones that I use when Im doing my heavy super heavy chest days and I need that extra bass pounding in my head then I rock these but the head the bass are nice it sounds great its nice and punchy no distortion the mids the highs everything is there they sound exactly like a set of JBL speakers and if you dont believe me check this out this how you know its JBL watch or not turn it on put the headphones about a month watch I turn it on you hear that sound thats the same sound when you turn on your JBL extreme or your JBL charge three that parent sound everything is the same JBL quality sound no complaints theyre nice and loud not like I said my Jim the music is super loud and sometimes its so loud that its annoying because if Im using my Y my truly wireless headphones like the gear headphones or the Jaybirds or the X shocked Souls when Im using those truly wireless headphones sometimes I cant use them in my gym because the the background music is too loud and they drown out my music so just now you know its the day before the fourth of July everybody trying to get that free barbecue workout on so my gym was just packed everybodys in there the music is mad loud they got the baseball game on they got the big three basketball game and music going on the same time I had these headphones on I didnt hear nothing also sound quality on these a1 overall like I said

headphones with that same device at the same time I wanted to show you how to do that its pretty simple and straightforward and the first thing youll need is a pair of power beats pro or earpods those are currently the only devices supported so well connect the air pods to and the power beats Pro the air pods are already connected to this device now you can see my air pods to are already paired now well need to pair a secondary device so let me set this down well open up the power beats Pro and do the same thing now we may need to hold the button down thats in here to repair them since they used to be paired but youll see it says connect and again it could be any pair of hat bluetooth headphones so you need to pair them the way you would normally pair bluetooth headphones and were holding this button there we go its connecting and now both of them are connected so weve got both of the headphones connected what Ill do is Ill put one of the air pods in my ear just so that we have it playing well hit done and then Ill take these out of the case just to show you how this works so well set this aside move these over and maybe we want to play a song or anything like that the easiest way to do this is just go to your control center go to music here tap on the little button here or 3d touch on the little airplay button and youll see we have not only my air pods but also power beats Pro so well tap on that now were connected to both and we can control the volume independently so this little family icon here will let you know that or do a person icon here will let you know that youre actually connected to multiple devices so if I 3d press on that volume button here youll see that you can adjust them individually for each device now instead of going through the control center if we go into music and we go to the song that were actually playing youve got the button down here the same exact thing and there are your air pods and power beats Pro or whatever you have connected to it you can adjust them together as far as volume goes or adjust them individually here if youd like to its a little bit easier in the control center but you can do it there as well if youd like to and thats really all there is to it if you want to share multiple stereo headphones with someone that way its a little bit better than maybe sharing one air pod with one person in your right ear and one in your left ear for the other person its much better to do it this way so if you have any of the supported devices this should work but let me know if you use this in the comments below and hopefully this helps of course Ill link this wallpaper in the description as I always do and if you have any other questions or suggestions please let me know in the comments below if you havent

"Closed Captions": " My last video was already two months ago Let me make a new one JBL recently launched a new line of headphones The JBL LIVE series These are the JBL LIVE 650BT and the JBL LIVE 500BT They are in the higher price range and they dont have big price difference With this review I help you have to choose which one to buy Before we start I want to ask you to subscribe to my channel and dont forget turn on the notification bubble so you dont miss any future videos on this channel So the price difference between these headphones is  50 These are the most key specs but why are we paying  50 more for the JBL LIVE 650BT The main answer is active noise cancellation Active noise canceling takes care of that the noise around you is filtered out so that you can fully enjoy your music Both headphones are neatly delivered in a sturdy packaging with the same accessories These accessories are a charging cable with a USB to a microUSB connection and an AUX cable This time JBL has added a braided cable that is usually whole are sturdy so JBL has earned points here I currently have the JBL LIVE 500BT in blue and the JBL LIVE 650BT in black but they are available in more colors The JBL LIVE 500BT retails for  150 For this price you get headphones with good sound quality in this price range The headphones have a battery life of 30 hours and works with Google Assistant amp Amazon Alexa Another feature is Ambient Aware amp Talkthru Technology which makes it possible to transfer your music With one click you can turn it down so you can hear or hear someone next to you better can hear your surroundings The JBL LIVE 650BT becomes sold for  200 For this price you have headphones according to the specifications with better sound quality but this is not clearly noticeable The headphones can be used for 20 hours with active noise canceling and without active noise canceling you can do them as much as possible Use for 30 hours The 650BT also works with Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa The 500BT has a headband with soft material in it While listening I have after a few hours it doesnt bother you but it does feel pretty hard The earpads are soft but they do not form completely to your ears These headphones can be folded so you can easily take it with you in a bag or a cover but you can also use a special headphone cover purchase because this is not included The lifespan of the headphones is good and that is why it does not break easily On the left you will find a number of buttons such as the on  off button the volume the aux connection the bluetooth button and the button for Ambient Aware amp Talkthru Technology There is only a microusb connection on the right to charge the headphones While they look fairly similar there are certainly differences in the materials used The LIVE 650BTs headband feels a lot like it softer and is also a lot thicker They are a lot more comfortable in the long run The ear pads also feel better and this shape much more to your ears as if the shape remains in it The LIVE 650BT is also foldable so you can easily take it with you and here is a headphone cover added Longevity is great too when you feel it put to the test which is still robust and sturdy To the left of the headphones are about it generally the same functions as with the LIVE 500BT Although with these headphones A button for active noise canceling has been added At the right there is also a microusb connection for charging So for  50 more you get an extra function more comfort and better based on the specifications sound But is it worth it If you are looking for headphones and you are not often on the road or you dont listen for hours on end then the LIVE 500BT very good headphones for this price If youre looking for headphones for general use and you are often on the road where a lot ambient noise and you listen for hours on end then in my opinion the LIVE 650BT is a better option despite the higher price You then get active noise canceling more comfort and a little better sound quality This makes listening to music is a lot more fun and you can last longer There is headphones for both the sound quality is fine but if you are a real bass fan I would recommend headphones with a bass boost or extra boost function If you want headphones that are cheaper but yes has active noise canceling check out my others review of the JBL TUNE600BTNC I put the link in the description or somewhere in the screen I think  you can find it Thanks for looking Are you going to buy one of these headphones Or have do

"Closed Captions": " hello everyone and welcome to another video so today in this video we will take a look at this wireless headphone and this is the boat rockers 450 Ive got this for about 200 rupees during the sale from Amazon dotting so this is how the headphone came in a red colored box and here you can see the boat local box you can see some of the specification or some of the features given here you can see HD sound it comes with bluetooth version 40 as you can see on the box adaptive earcups the speaker size or the driver size in this red phone is 40 millimeter and the company is claiming about 8 hours of battery time and we will do the test in our usage at the back you can see a picture of circle the one at the side you can see the boat logo gained so without any further delay let me just open it and see what we get in the box and see how it works and how to connect it with a cell phone so easy to open once you get this out you can flip it like this so once you open it you get to see this accessories I will take a look at in a second let me just get the earphone out so you get the air phone out all you have to do is basically take this out and take this wrapper out there we go so let me put all these things back in the box theres nothing in the box left now so let me keep the box aside and lets just focus on our project ok so this is how the earphone look as you can see these are very squishy very soft velvet kind of a texture on the ear cups inside you can see your forty millimeter speaker it is adjustable as you can see both the sides are adjustable and this is the maximum adjustment settings that you get lets compress it together you also get the cushion for the top of your head at the back you can see that it you can fold it without any problem so you can pretty much do like this and it becomes really portable I had to carry to open it all you have to do is bring it outside and then you can use it again without any problem you can see on the both these speakers you get the both local and here is both written as well this finish on the body of the headphone is kind of a matte smooth finish its not very simply a slippery so this is how pretty much the earphone looks one thing that I am going to complain about this is because there is the buttons on this earphone are very smooth so when you are hearing it when you are wearing it I its very difficult to differentiate between different buttons yeah sometimes what I was doing was I was kind of clicking here and then here because I was unable to differentiate between the body of the headphone and the buttons so once if you are using more than one earphone headphone then we will find it a little difficult but if youre just using this one your hands will get used to the different buttons so the buttons could have been a little bigger and a little more outside the body one of the good thing about this headphone is that it also has your 35 millimeter jack so if you run out of batteries you can power this with the 35 millimeter cable that also comes in the box here is your power on LED so this is how pretty much the body and the features on this headphones are it is also a micro USB a charge port so there we go now lets take a look at what we get in the box that is the packet that we caught in the box and let me just open it so inside you will get a manual looks like a 1year married medic manufacturer warranty card and also there is one pamphlet for different products from the board so lets keep it aside and lets take a look at the charging cable so you get a small not so good quality but decent about one meter or a little less than that micro USB charging cable so thats very common and you will also get a very not so good quality so that this cable is not a very good quality this is very flimsy but this is let me just show you what is the length of the cable okay so the length of the auxiliary cable is about one meter long but this is handy because once you run out of batteries inside your earphone you can plug in this cable and continue listening to your headphones okay so lets keep all the accessories on the side and lets let me show you how you can pair this headphone with the your phone so here you can see that here are three buttons as you can see one is your plus button the other is your pause play button so you can see that the middle button is your pause play button on the top on the best on the very right you will see your plus button and the very right you will see you minus button but now turn on the earphone all you have to do is basically press the middle button for a three four second until you see the LED blinking so let me just press it in as you can see the LED will start blinking now and you will also hear the sound that it is ready to pair so it is not blinking so let me just bring my phone in and show you how to pair it so you can see that there it is not blinking here is my redmi note 7 let me turn it on on your phone go to your Bluetooth setting turn the Bluetooth all in once the bluetooth is on keep press the Bluetooth button and you will see the board rockers 450 as you can see and on the side you can see the LED click on the board records for 50 and it will it will say a pairing and once it is paired press the power button and you will also have that the headphone will say that it is now connected to the boat rockers 450 and you will see the battery percentage and it will say connected so at the moment the battery is about 60 and this is how you can use pretty much anything now let me show you how you can change different setting inside the headphone okay so as you can see I have my one of my youtube videos playing from my youtube playlist now this is how you can control your music or watching videos so there are three buttons the middle button is your pause playback button as you can see at the moment the video is playing to pause the video I will have to press the pause button let me present pause button once and as you can see the music is talk if I play the pause button again the music or the video will is continuous start playing to go to the previous track I will all I will have to do is press the plus button for a couple of second Im pressing the plus button now and its changed to the previous video and it will start playing if I want to go to the next track I will press the minus button for a couple of second let me press the minus button and its switched to the next track and this is how you can control the playing music and the videos when using the headphone now let me show you how you can increase the volume of the earphone to increase the volume there are plus and minus button to increase the volume tapping start tapping the plus button until you hear the headphone say maximum volume so and to decrease the volume all you have to do is press the minus button keep tapping it until you hear the minimum volume so this is how you can control the the music the videos with the headphone with the patterns that are present on the earphone so let me listen to a couple of music tracks and spend some time with this headphone and I will see you after at least two days okay so now Ive been using the headphone for about three days now and about three days I have some opinions about this headphone so starting with the audio quality I think the audio quality and the loudness of this headphone was really really good when it comes to the of wearing the it was really really comfortable when you will use it for the first time I think it would be a little tight but after using this for a couple of minutes you will get used to it so when the first day I started using it my ears started hurting after 15 minutes after that I removed the headphone and started using them after 15 minutes and then I was able to put it for longer times so once you get used to it it will be easier for you to wear them so in the audio quality there are three mainly three points the high section the mid section and the base so bass is very very important so the base of this headphone was very very good I really like the bass on this headphone so I think bass is probably the highlight top of this headphone overall now talking about the mid section where you get your dialogues when someone is talking to or the other person or someone is talking to you in the into the camera that comes in at the mid section the mid section is also really really good it is very clear but sometimes a bass is a little overpowering to my taste but again audio is very subjective your preference may vary so again Audio is very very different if I like something its not necessarily that you will like that too lets talk about the high high section which is the very when you have very sharp notes a very treble the Travel section of this of the headphone is also very very good its also comparable to the mid section but bass is the highlight of this headphone so times when theres very little volume in the treble at those section of the treble are not easier to listen overall I would give this headphone about 8 out of 10 and with the for the bass I would give this about 9 out of 10 so if I had the money and I wanted to buy this headphone again I would definitely put my money into this I bought this with my own money so this is not a biased review now lets talk about the battery life the company on the box claims that the batteries on this headphone will last you about eight hours in mice testing while listening to the headphone for about at about 60 to 70 percent volume I was able to get more than eight hours somewhere close to 10 hours without any problem the headphone was really really loud so at 60 to 70 percent volume I did not have to increase the volume anymore lets talk about the call quality I only talk to two people through the mic thats thats inside there so you can see that there is a small hole which is your microphone so if you are using the headphone and talking to some other person on the phone the audio was clear but I imagined that in a noisy environment it would be a problem so I cant say anything about the mic just yet I will have to use it a little more but I will let you guys know in the comments after using this for a couple more days okay so lets talk about the battery life the battery levels very very good and the charging time we will do the charging test in a second because Ive drained the headphones completely and this is the cable that came in the box this is you can use when the battery of the headphone is completely dead using the wire was much much better not much was better about a little better when using the Bluetooth because wire transmits a very clean signal and the wires are literally a little powerful nothing can beat when you connect something with the pop with the wire so there we go this was my complete review of this boat rockers 450 wireless bluetooth headphones I really like this headphone and I would disc headphones or thumbs up so thank you guys for watching and I will see you guys in my next video if you have any question you can put them in the comments and I will try to answer them as soon as possible by all right then so the batteries of our headphone is completely dead now so lets do the charging test and figure out how long this headphone takes to charge so Ive got the manual here and as you can see in the manual the charging time is given about if the camera focuses its about 35 hours to 45 hours lets just see how long it takes in my test so Im using the charger of my redmi note 7 let me just plug that in inside our extension Im using the cable that came in the package so this is the cable that came in V with the headphone this is about half a meter long a little longer than half a meter long that meters that plug it in for its in and if you look at the headphone you will see that there is this micro USB charging port and once you plug it in you will see a LED glowing so let me just plug it in so its plugged in and here you can see LED and here is also your microphone we will talk about the microphone later so let me just plug the extension on you can see the red LED is glowing and the red LED will stop glowing once the batteries are completely charged so let me start a timer and lets measure how long it takes to charge this headphone so Ive got my phone here lets start the timer lets see how long it takes to charge okay so as you can see the LED has stopped glowing the red LED err I forgot to check one time but I believe that it it was completely charged in about one hour one hour forty to fifty minutes almost a little less than two hours so this is the charging time of the board rockers 450 Music",

are the bose noisecanceling headphones are picked for the best noise canceling wireless headphones if youre working in a noisy office or you just want to drowned out the environment around you then youll want a pair of great noise cancelling headphones and bose has just the right ones priced under 400 their noise cancelling headphones not only reduce outside sounds but theyre Wireless as well with a few features tossed in for good measure these wireless headphones feature 11 separate levels of noise cancellation to customize the amount of sound you want to get in and out this feature helps with voice calls by allowing you to adjust the level of noise cancellation so you can isolate your own voice from surrounding noise leading to better concentration it doesnt stop it calls either if youre doing some late night movie watching at high volume and dont want to disturb your family these headphones will keep sound from spilling out and potentially waking them up they can even be paired with a bose sound bar for a little extra convenience the headphones can also handle voice commands from AI assistants like Alexa thanks to a builtin microphone sound wise these Bose headphones offer excellent audio thanks to a wide sound space good bass response and pleasantly surprising clarity this is an excellent plus for a pair of wireless headphones speaking of wireless most noise cancelling headphones are still traditionally wired meaning Bose is offering a very versatile product if you like flexibility in your headsets unfortunately battery life is limited compared to some of its rivals but still relatively robust at around 20 hours of use without needing a recharge for a pair of headphones with stronger battery life check out the sony WH 1000 XM 3s which is coming up next Bose offers a great product with a surprising amount of noise cancellation options for those who want to listen to music movies and other media without any distraction up next is the sony WH 1000 XM 3 our pick for the best overall wireless headphones if youre after a set of balanced best overall wireless headphones it can be really hard to narrow down a winner the sony WH 1000 XM 3s are a solid option for a price under 300 with a lot of features to offer the discerning listener the WH 1000s includes some of the features of the bose wireless headphones previously mentioned in this video including support for AI assistants like Alexa and Google assistant plus noise canceling technology it does offer a few new surprises however one of these is the quick attention mode which allows you to cover the right ear cup and turn down your music without having to fumble for a volume knob or pause button touch controls also let you raise and lower volume change tracks or take calls by tapping the ear phone which is a nice touch since engine technology also listens to the activity around you and automatically tweaks and balances audio even during high altitude flights these headphones are also quite comfortable to wear thanks to their ergonomic design and slim ear cuffs that reduce their overall weight and allows them to be worn for extended periods which is great if youre on a long road trip or an overseas flight one of the best features however is the battery life estimated at around 30 hours on a single charge this is a step up from the Bose noise canceling headphones by an extra 10 hours if that werent enough a mere 10 minutes of charging time can net an astounding 5 hours of playback which is great if you forgot to charge them up before heading out they dont offer the same level of noise cancelling customization as the Bose headphones nor is call quality is good but these are minor drawbacks to an otherwise excellent set of cans the Sony WH 1000 XM 3 s blend great sound with a host of fantastic features that make them an excellent around contendere next we have the NS series 10 wireless earbuds our pick for the best budget wireless earbuds there are plenty of budget wireless earbuds on the market but finding a standout can be tough which is why the NS series 10 wireless earbuds are such a treat for the discerning audiophile for a price under 50 not only are they convenient but comfortable while providing excellent sound quality for a device at this price range newly released in early 2020 its quickly becoming one of the toprated earbuds on the market and its easy to see why the series 10 wireless earbuds achieve great audio quality through a specially designed double moving coil eight millimeter horn for excellent tonal range and clarity CVC noise cancelling helps to shut the outside world out when all you want to do is immerse yourself fully in your music each earbud can be paired with a different device in case you wish to break up their functionality for the testing of different products these earbuds also feature a microphone for voice calls without the need for a separate microphone or smart phone a simple three light system helps identify the charge level of the left and right earbuds and the charging box so you can keep track of how much juice is left in each Ive compared these two my ear pods Pro and although the air pods Pro were better in almost every way they were a lot more similar than you might expect the size of the cases are identical the battery life was not far off they were similar in comfort ability and fit the noise cancellation was much better on the air pods Pro but the sound quality was comparable to the point most non hardcore music lovers will not notice much of a difference considering they cost a fifth of the price of the air pods Pro its really easy to see there is a lot of liked about them for the price theyre very portable provide excellent sound great comfort and a premium feel if youre looking for a budget earbud or just dont care to spend hundreds of extra dollars for a product that you may not use all the features on anyway this is easily a top choice on the market if youre

want to find the most updated information check the description if you find this video helpful please help out the channel by giving this video a like and tell us which product caught your eye in the comments below up next is the Jabra elite 85h our pick for some great overall wireless headphones unless youre an audiophile who is hip to the latest sonic technology you may find it difficult to decide on a great pair of wireless headphones that sound good and sport great features the Java elite 85h wireless headphones are a surefire contender with a price under 250 dollars theyre welldesigned featurerich and sound great with a few pleasant surprises tossed in as well these noisecanceling headphones include smart sound and smart active noise cancellation that work in tandem to automatically cancel out environmental sound if things get too noisy while providing excellent sound and voice call quality this is achieved by utilizing six of the eight builtin microphones to enhance the quality of your phone calls while gating out wind and other distracting noises the 85h also includes a I assistant integration for Alexa Siri and Google assistant voice commands the 85 hs are very warm and balanced out of the box with firm mids and low end base that can be custom tailored within the Jabra sound Plus app for precise eqe theres even a bass boost setting for those who want a bit more Rumble even though the 85 HS can produce a bit of distortion with this setting on at higher volumes battery life is the real star here offering the whopping 36 hours of playback on a single charge which puts it ahead of others on our list like the Sony WH 1000 X m3 although sound quality is fantastic theyre not quite up to par with the Sonys however but they are priced more competitively they also lack support for highend audio codecs like AAC or LD AC which can affect lossless playback however the Jabra Elite 85 hs are well suited for those who simply want a great pair of cans and dont require absolute pitch perfection in their music for this reason there is solid choice for anyone who might be unsure which pair of headphones to pick finally we have the Apple earpods Pro our pick for the best wireless headphones for Apple users if youre active and on the go then traditional headphones can present a major problem that is easily solved by buying a pair of gray earbuds for Apple users the air pods Pro is a topnotch option that eliminates the bulk of headphones for easier portability and convenience for a price under 250 dollars if youre an Apple iPhone user the air pods pro are perfect companions and designed with that particular device in mind they are compatible with the latest gen iPhones and are already tied into the Apple ecosystem for a nofuss setup the air pods prou offer noise canceling technology that can quickly toggle the transparency mode by long pressing on the stem other touch controls include single squeezing the stem to play music double squeezing to advance to the next track or triple squeezing to skip backward to the previous track this is a relatively simple and straightforward set of touch controls that Apple users will find instantly recognizable and intuitive connection to an Apple device is a very simple affair provided youre on iOS 13 point to a simple prompt allows you to instantly connect with the push of a button for a hassle free set up Android and Windows users shouldnt fret either the air pods pro is fully compatible with both eco systems via a more traditional bluetooth pairing scheme that can have you up and running in no time the only real caveat of the air pods Pro is Apples insistence on having them charged via lightning cable which may be offputting to many users who prefer a universal USB C interface also the stem design may not be to everyones tastes but they are meant to be functional and the squeeze controls more than make up for the slightly divisive look few wireless earbuds are as well designed and robust as the air pods pro and Apple users especially will love how seamlessly they integrate with their existing iPhones with great sound a match alright guys thats all for now

"qv3fYcix7G0", "Closed Captions": " Hello everyone and welcome to this brand new Techboost review For this review we tested headphones under  100 with Bluetooth and Noise Canceling You better be ready for the JBL TUNE600BTNC Because if these are available in every country they are the cheapest JBL headphones with Noise Canceling So lets see if these are the headphones youve been looking for for weeks or for months or years  Anyway the headphones box is pretty simple Nothing special about it At the back you can see the headphones in the box and there are also some specifications on the back but Ill get to that later First we will see what we find in the packaging As you can see the headphones come in a sturdy plastic package and they come With two cables A white and an orange cable These cables are a good start to it about the accessories and the first is the manual for the JBL TUNE600 The second is the white cable and this is the audio cable because you can do this use headphones wirelessly and wired The third is the orange cable and this is the charging cable Its a MicroUSB to USBA cable so it is probably the umpteenth for the cable collection These headphones need 2 hours charging and this makes the battery life 12 hours but Noise Canceling plays a big role role in this If you use Noise Canceling the battery will run out It lasts 12 hours and if you dont use it you can enjoy your favorite music for up to 22 hours You may be asking yourself now what are the main specifications Well let me answer that question for you On the right side of the JBL TUNE you will find every connection and button On top of there is a MicroUSB connection for the charging cable At the bottom is the volume control an audio jack the Noise Canceling button and the on  off button that also turns on the Bluetooth Because there is a separate button for Noise Canceling we speak of  Active Noise Canceling  You can easily turn it on and off I have had the TUNE600 for a week now and have it with and without Noise Cancellation and I have to admit its a good feature But dont expect them to be better than more expensive headphones with Noise Cancellation They are excellent for the price Because they are onear headphones the  Passive Noise Reduction  is not as good as overear headphones As I mentioned earlier the battery life depends on the use of Noise Cancellation As with other JBL headphones the battery indicator leaves you alone know when to charge it The JBL app supports this JBL TUNE600BTNC not yet as far as I know But you can look for apps that have the percentage display battery of Bluetooth devices connected to your phone Lets talk about the materials and build quality of the JBL TUNE600 The headphones have neat leather ear cushions and the headband also has a leather cushion And the headphones mainly consist of sturdy plastic Build quality is good but not great You can extend the headband and the headphones feel solid but you dont want to stretch them too long because its guaranteed to break  In addition you can also fold the JBL TUNE600 so that you can easily take it with you To be clear no cover or case is included Okay everyone now the most important part Based on the sound quality they amazed me The vocals sound great the bass is good and the instruments come into their own So its perfect for the music Im listening to and really worth the money in my opinion But they are still onear headphones and they have a serious amount of sound loss So you cant use everywhere at a normal volume unless you want angry faces around you Another thing I want to talk about is the comfort of the headphones because this is the biggest drawback They are simply not comfortable They are sitting very tight and after an hour they hurt and I want to take them off Maybe this is a personal matter but they are different in comparison with other JBL headphones So in general they are really worth the money Sound quality is great compliments to JBL The Noise Canceling is a great feature and the durability is reasonable Based on the fit I advise everyone to try them before buying Maybe they suit you maybe they dont At the time of this review prices are around 99 dollars or 130 euros And they are available in WHITE BLACK BLUE and PINK colors Let me know which headphones you are currently using or maybe you will buy the JBL 600TUNE Regardless I hope this review helped you If so leave a comment leave a like and subscribe to my channel for more upcoming videos I leave the product links in the description before the most recent sales prices And

"collection_date": "20201007 102245937461", "video_id": "ecunTtMlFeg", "Closed Captions": " hi guys this is Ranjith Ann in this video lets do the review of the Sennheiser HD 315 bluetooth headphones and quite a few of you have asked me to actually test out some reputable audio brand for example senator is a very old audio brand this is a company from Germany and they do make what do you say highend headphones microphones etc for example in movies and stuff a lot of sensor microphones are used in stuff like that so I thought why not test some of them and this one is one of their most affordable Bluetooth headphones and this is a new range of the BT 350 and they also have 450 450 has active noise cancellation this is not hot and guys this is not a review nut or anything I purchased this one from Amazon and I purchased this on 26th of July and I purchase it for five thousand nine hundred but today when I looked at Amazon the pricing is 7490 I just wanted to be transparent about that so lets look at this and I would say initially when I got it the first day I was hugely disappointed with this one and if it was just the first day of usage I would have given a very low rating of just four out of ten because the sound simply did not sound that good on this one but after a Berlin of about almost about 12 or 13 hours that cans really opened up and then the sound signature was good but again I wont say this is for everyone if you are looking for that extended bass or something then you will simply not like it this is sort of for more of the purest kind of person but again it simply does not have that regular Sennheiser a sound signature that was very surprising to me but before we talk about the sound what I like what I did not like lets have a closer look at this and as you can see it comes in this big box over here and we also have an app for both iPhone as well as Android I tested it on Android so Ill just keep the box to the side so these are the earphones and as you can see you can fold them like this and by the way guys no case was also given in the box so nothing that get in the box apart from this you just get a USB typec charging cable so it folds in like this and again the entire construction is plastic guys but the build quality is good as you can see I can flex it and it will not break so the build quality is actually good and much better than some of the other headphones that are even more expensive than this one I have noticed and again this level like this and this one also swagger struggles and we have quite a bit of padding here so it was comfortable to me on my ears but again guys this is just a vehicle leather kind of a thing so what I did notice is that after you wear it for about 45 minutes your gears will definitely get a little bit warm so after 45 minutes I had to just remove it for some time for five minutes and wear it again so that is something that you have to its not breathable material but again in terms of their comfort they were comfortable to me its not like my Bose QC 35 or the Sony WH 8000 MX that I have those are even more comfortable but they cost about 25 to 30 thousand so in that way its good but one thing that I noticed is that if you look at this your cup the your cup so the cavity is slightly small I would say its not a problem for my ears but again if you have a very big head again as you can see it what not cover your head fully so that is one thing that I notice and this is very strange coming from Sennheiser so that is something that I have noticed so you got to be careful with that in terms of connectivity here I like this one it supports new Bluetooth 5 and also has optics and Arctics low latency and that aptX low latency is great if you have androidbased smartphones they use that hence I did not have that lag that generally we have but bluetooth headphones even I watched a couple of movies a lot of videos I did not have that lip sync a show whereas I didnt test it with the iPhone with iPhone it will actually use a CC so Im not very clear how good it will be in terms of that lip singing but when Android it was not so now lets go the physical aspect and if you look at it this is the right here and here you have a lot of buttons lets start from this side well this one is actually the power onoff button and you actually hold it for four seconds if you want to re pair it with another device and the pairing process was very comfortable not an issue and if you go over here you have the USB typec port with this one and I would say the battery life is terrific on this one the box says 30 us but I feel the battery life will go even beyond 30 us because after almost about even 20 hours of usage its still it was showing me around 50 percent battery life so I feel the battery life is a big strength of this one next if we move this is for the volume you can increase or load the one for example if you look at this this is an interesting button let me actually play it back as you can see my phone over here Ill just keep it here and Ill just press this its playing music now and if I just move like this its going to move to the next track and if you press slide it down it moves so its very easy to navigate as you can see like this so I like that and if you want to pause the music you just press it once like this and the last button what we have is for Google assistant nfu but I said the Google assistant will invoke on your a smart phone so thats regarding the buttons and I would say the navigation has done very well on this it takes a couple of hours to get used to it Ill just pause the music guys but you get used to it very quickly and guys one strange thing I notice is that nowhere it is sort of written left and right so the right can cup has all the buttons dont were at the other side and thats the mistake I did initially so in terms of buttons layout its good and the Bluetooth range is excellent excellent on this one generally with many of the Bluetooth headset yes obviously it works in that room and if you just go outside the second term also some work some dont want this even work in the third room also which is actually very rare so in terms of Bluetooth connectivity they have done an incredible job err in my testing address this to smartphones this is the Samsung Note 10 live and even on the Motorola 1 fusion class and I did not have any issues in terms of Bluetooth connect tree so the Bluetooth connectivity is very strong on this one and now lets also talk about because we are doing a lot of work from home and staff we also do peak calls with this one it has integrated microphone on this one and you can take calls with this one and I would say the call quality I had mixed experiences with this one dont get me wrong other parties did not complain that I was sounding muddy or something so it looks like the microphone quality is good but what happened is that the receivers calls were sounding very unnatural it was doing some sort of processing so it was looking like it was coming from echo chamber so I did not like the incoming calls so again I did not like it if they should have just left it to natural they are doing some postprocessing to amplify the vocals when you Im taking calls looks like that and I simply did not like that its not a deal breaker but I thought you guys should know that but in terms of battery life I know because of work from home most of you are actually wearing headphones for couple of hours that way the battery life is excellent now lets talk about one more thing on this one is lets talk about the sound because we get this for sound and as Ive told you right now the pricing is for 7500 so Ill take that in my mind and I checked even in us generally there are about 100 dollars so its almost the same price that we are getting in us and here I had some very mixed reactions with this one again as Ive told you guys you have to burn and this one for at least 10 to 12 hours but initially they sounded like the rubbish cans I was so disappointed with them but after the burnin I feel it open quite a bit but still I would say after the burnin now have used it for more than 20 22 hours I am assuming and still I would say the sound signature is not the typical sound signature that I would like from us and hyzer for example in bass yes bass is there its not for bass edge if you are thinking that you are a basin and you like it youll absolutely hate this one so its not for bass heads but I know many of people who do not like that excessive bass that makes is there it comes but again the bass is not that punchy that I have noticed and that brings me to the midtones and the vocals here I enjoyed it quite a bit for example I listened to a lot of hindi songs also and those sounded brilliant on them because a lot of hindi songs have a lot of midrange instruments and a lot of vocals they sounded beautiful on this one and in terms of genres of music before I talk about that in terms of hi this was very very surprising to me generally the said Iser headphones earphones the highs are produced brilliantly on them they have that sparkle feeling but that sparkle was simply missing on this one in fact I would say the highs were something that disappointed me considering its Earths Anheuser because most of the sennheiser for body said your phones headphones have that slight sparkle on the treble end that was missing on this one fortunately what do you say by default what we had Id simply did not like it but Sennheiser has an app for example let me just open it so very basic app works for both Android as well as what do you say iPhones and as you can see its got a connected a texture what do you say phone it takes about a couple of seconds and as you can see it detected and it shows the battery life also as I Polly the battery life is one of those insane things and here we dont have a proper equalizer but as you can see you can customize this for example you can move this and this actually equalizes stuff and I had to do this with this for example Im just going to invert this I made some by default will be this neutral like this and here I felt that the base and even the treble tones was slightly lacking I simply did not enjoy so I had to play around with this one and I put it here and I felt it was much better my daughter actually made this profile she listens to a lot of music trebles on and as you can see she had to boost up the treble quite a bit but the problem with this one is that for example if you boosting the treble like this the others Soundwave automatically adjust so very difficult to get the right pattern that you want you can definitely get it I have made some profiles here I basically like this trap slightly boosted troubles on this one and that way the sound signature improved so I dont like the fact that the default sound profile it neither pleases me on the base end nor on the higher end yes the vocals and the mid tones are really good so you have to really play with the app and get that setting right yes you can do it and I played for it for a couple hours and I got the profile right but again its just too much work I feel for a headphone that is costing about 7500 to get the right sound signature and if you got an impatient person then you will simply not like this one because it requires a lot of work the good thing is that once you tweak the sound signature and set it it is actually set on the headphones and I used it with another what do you say phone that sound profile is automatically used so it stores that setting on the headphone so that is something that you like but I mean you got to play with that and if you are expecting boosted bass and something like that and this is not for you and if I have to read this one I would rate this one at about seven out of ten considering we dont get that typical sound signature and that sparkle on the high end that we expect from Sennheiser headphones for example to come here this one I had the audio technica m50x its not a fair comparison thats a wider headphone and actually cost a little bit more I think so thats for eleven thousand that sounded very better than this one I enjoyed it a lot more and I would say if you dont want to if you are on a budget I have reviewed some sin either bad earphones for example the Sennheiser CX 275 s thats for just 1500 rupees I felt I enjoyed the music a little bit more on that one because that had that typical Sennheiser sound signature so again a for people who do not like that excessive bass mostly if you like that neutral sound signature you like it but again if you are expecting that typical sennheiser sparkle on the high end these might not be for you so anyways guys thats it for my review of this one analyze if youre buying this use my link it does have the channel buying a lot of stuff myself and if you are a buy stuff from my

truly wireless earbuds and in the recent prime day sale they drop the me super bass wireless headphones in India now apart from Bluetooth 50 and a powerful base the most iconic thing about this headphones is the battery backup yes 20 hours of playback on a single charge at this price point its unprecedented but how does it hold up in real life Music well heres a TL DW version the audio quality is decent battery life is awesome and it really gets some comfortable after 45 minutes and thats it thats a whole review but if thats not enough heres a detail look at this me wireless headphones so the first thing you get in the box is the headphones a micro USB charging cable well a Type C would be more appreciated but anyway and then an aux cable which means you can also use it as a regular headphones when the battery dies cool now the design doesnt look promising in the pictures but turns out its pretty decent so theres this cushion in the headband area something that you dont see often at this price and then the ear cups are on air with a little bit of suspension I will come to that later the music controls are simple you change the volume with these two and this one is for force and invoking the voice assistant on your phone now talking about the audio quality Xiaomi claims that the 40mm driver in this one will give you extra bass and well in my opinion the bass is decent and so is the audio quality I have seen better audio quality at this price point like the tag but what Id really like is there is little to no latency on this bluetooth headphones yes you can do a quick pubsey session while youre traveling now Im no fan of taking calls on bluetooth headphones and earphones and although this one also comes with a mic its just possible at best the other party might have a hard time understanding you theres also Bluetooth 50 which in theory will give you more coverage better connectivity and battery life now coming down to the most flaunted feature on this headphones Xiaomi claims that this headphones can last 20 hours on a single charge and well in a limited testing it turns out to be true we never had to charge it the battery is 90 after three hours of usage in my opinion the most important thing about any wireless headphones is comfort now Im not expecting to see 35 level of comfort but at the same time it should not hurt my ears for at least to us and unfortunately thats not the case here you see the problem is with an ear design theyre not good with mild activity a little shake in the head and they will follow they get really uncomfortable after our or so and not to forget they also leak noise in the environment so you wont be able to listen to your lady Gaga playlist in front of your colleagues its about time that company should stop making on your headphones the design is just too old and has a lot of flaws without any actual benefit now just to have a bigger picture lets compare it with some of the most popular wireless headphones at this price point like boat tag Motorola JBL and Sony etc and then it can outperform most of them in audio quality and battery life no doubt there but I will still prefer Motorola for the comfort due to the over ear design and tack for its audio quality so finally who should buy this well just like any Xiaomi program these are good headphones under 2000 rupees but definitely not the best you see the audio quality is decent battery life is awesome but it really gets uncomfortable after 45 minutes so it should be fine for 40 minutes of commute or a gym but definitely not for a long use at school home or office alternatively you can also take a look at Xiaomi wireless earphones err dots over here and subscribe to this channel if you havent already its

"Tby7ow9UFq4", "Closed Captions": " hey everybody hope youre having a great Bose sound sport free wireless sounding day and today Im looking forward to giving you a review and demo my overall experience with these Bose headphones I had really an opportunity to put them to the test and I look forward to sharing with you just again my full experience and Ill give you some examples as well get some closeups how the app works connecting to your phone all the good stuff been a bose fan for a long time although its been a little while since ive worn any Bose headphones I had picked up the Apple earpods because I knew of nothing really that Bose was coming out and then two weeks later BAM they they just came out with these headphones so Im excited I initially had the sound sport wireless headphones but then there were some issues with crackling and hopefully they have really put these to the test to make an overall experience really good one and theyre really cool a lot of features and capabilities so lets dive right in and I will put a link in the description where you can read other reviews order them they will be coming with other colors Ill put a link to my open boxing as well as my comparison video of how I thought the two matched up and which ones I gave a thumbs up to so lets go ahead and get started first of all when taking these out and charged them up for the first time theres two indicators as far as charge and got the case here its down to one of five bars this will hold up to ten hours of charging and the headphones also have an indicator when theyre in the case for charging those hold five hours so youre getting combined fifteen hours together and and again then you can just charge up the case and take it to go with you as far as the case eyes it is a very big case a little bit too big for my like you think about this case more if youre going to putting your purse in a bag whatever might be then carrying in your pocket because you put in your pocket gonna feel like its gonna drag your your pants down its bulky and you know so I think its you know unfortunately just too big so I do keep that in mind but what you know it is what it is but if you are concerned about taking them on the go you know as I thought with the Apple earpods they slip right into your pockets so you know again keep that in mind I do want to by the way talk about price point 250 very expensive again this is on a premium headphones but you know it is a steep price point and at the end of the video Ill share with you if that justifies the cost so you know again I think theyre a little bit high but you know Bose again makes a premium product so you pay for what you get but do they deliver with everything for that kind of money so lets talk about comfort with the ear pieces these are a silicone rubberized material they do fit in the ears very well its got these wingtips and they just sit in the ear and once you put them in now initially when I put them in my ears they were they were uncomfortable for a little bit because I just had to get used to wearing them I dont you know Ive always been a big fan but maybe because I hadnt worn him for a little while I just take a little getting it just to  because I again I was wearing the Apple earpods but they stay in the air very comfortable to wear and and the nice part is they come in a few different sizes for the ear pieces with the wingtips which that very well on the ear have always been a fan of these ear pieces they come in three sizes you got the small the medium and the large the medium will be on the ear pieces when you take it out of the packaging I found the smaller size fits best for my ear its a very soft silicone rubberized piece the rubberized or the white piece here this can be bent so its a little bit of a harder rubberized material but what I love about what Bose has done is made it so easy to put these on ear pieces so you basically just slide it on like this and it just locks right into place just like that its on just that easy and again for the lefty area you just slide it on and then theres a little hook here and then you just hook that on into place and you are good to go again very easy to change very comfortable to put in your ears so as you can see its very easy to put on and again they are extremely comfortable to wear so when taking them out of the casing once youve got them all charged up its a its very cool it does tell you it gives you an indicator one how much percentage of battery life is remaining and two it will say its now connected to your device so thats really cool feature when youre taking them out now you could turn that notification on and off with the app and Ill show you that towards the end of the video where Ill get into more of the app and the details there so very cool there as far as again the headphones very comfortable they stayed in the ear well I even when I was working out and getting on a pension depending upon lequip meant you know stayed in they stayed in very well so as far as next up bluetooth connectivity Bluetooth connectivity worked very well I did put them to the test at the gym where on one side of the gym I had my phone sitting in my bag and then I walked the other side of the gym and I was able to walk 56 steps where before it broke up so I was able to go a good distance I also did a test where I went into another room around the walls and the connection connection stayed very well so that is you know a very good thing as far as the connection with the Bluetooth so one of the negative is however with the Bluetooth is lip syncing when watching a video so Im going to show you here a difference when watching a video on YouTube versus watching a video on your phone and youll see unfortunately the syncing does not really match up very well on the YouTube but it does seem to work okay watch videos on the phone so if watching videos is important to you with these headphones then youre gonna get frustrated so do keep in mind but here we go heres an example of both with the YouTube video and on the phone okay so first Im going to show you the YouTube video this is me doing a review on a Brooke shoe Im going to go ahead and put the right ear piece next to my microphone so you can hear the audio as I press play okay so you clearly can hear how the lips did not match the voice now just to show you I am going to now show you this video of video I just recorded directly into the phone and how the lips do match the voice again I will put the earpiece next to my microphone so you can hear while watching the video so let me go ahead and press play so you can clearly see how the video did match the video shot right on the phone directly so as far as listening to music this is where Ive always been a very big fan of bows their music sounds great the music pops great bass overall great experience and in these headphones do get very loud so that is a plus but you do hear some of the background noise even at full blast or the highest volume so do keep that in mind but again the sound from listening to rock the jazz I did have different types of testing and music sounded very good one of the things to keep in mind which is in combination with the Bluetooth connection and listening music is you have to have the right year out of case so you dont have the flexibility if you just want to listen on the right ear or the left ear it will be in both I mean you could keep the left ear in the case and youll still hear out of the right ear but you dont have the flexibility of deciding which your piece you want to listen to music out of so again just keep that in mind with listening to music but music is superb as far as phone calls I was very pleased with phone calls Bose has a good microphone I found I was able to hear people well people were able to hear me well one of the challenges again with the earpieces is that you can only hear your phone calls out of the right ear you cant have it listen with the left ear so unfortunately that to me is a little frustrating where as well with the music you want to have that flexibility you cant have that with these headphones so do keep that in mind now what I want to do is that play some examples of calls so you can hear the call quality but also hear background noise in three examples one is at my computer where I had some music in the background the second is in my car and third its at the gym so that will give you a perspective of three different types of environments how it picks up and and then Ill be back and give you my my thoughts there Im leaving a voicemail test with the sound sport free wireless headphones I have music playing in the background so I want you to hear the noise that I picked up in the background with music and Im sitting right by my computer Im going to step away from my computer now stepping away from my computer I am about six feet or late maybe a little less than six feet from my computer I hope this part of the review is of help if you enjoy the wireless headphones I am doing a voice mail test of the Bose sound support free wireless headphones I am on the highway driving so it gives you an idea of how the voice sounds as well as a background noise if youre in the car making a call and I am doing about 60 miles an hour hope this part of the review is a help I am leaving a voicemail test as a method Jim wanted to hear any background sound and it did pick up Im using the Bose sound for free wireless headphones I hope this part of the reviewers have helped have a great day okay so you did although there was background noise I found you I would still have to hear my voice so do keep in mind you know with the background noise in the microphone it doesnt completely block that the background noise out but I think it does a pretty good job its certainly not perfect but that will give you an idea there so what I want to do next and last is to share with you some examples how to connect your phone to the app also Ill get into the controllers as well and in some other videos that I find would be helpful so my final thoughts before I share that with you is I do like these headphones it is price point very high the case is too big there are some to me some challenges as far as the flexibility there so you know Im still up in the air here what I what I want to do Ive been really pleased with the Apple earpods and they really do give bow is a good run for the money bows again makes it an excellent product but great sound music good call quality you know these are you know these do look funny Casey nice that said they look like pacifiers in the ears because you know they are they are so big the way they they stick out but you know most importantly are you getting a good experience do you get to enjoy your music do you get to enjoy the calls and again keep in mind as well for YouTube videos youre gonna have an issue there so thanks again for watching this video again you know be sure to click on the link where you can read other reviews of course order them and last but not least here are other helpful videos and I hope the rest of this video is enjoyable and beneficial thanks again for watching here you go ok lets go ahead and pair the sounds board free headphones to my iPhone Im gonna go ahead and open up the app as you can see opens up to the black and white logo gives you some information here they have to agree Bose Connect collects diagnostic and usage data to improve our product and services troubleshoot errors if you do not want to collect this data you can opt out through the privacy policy tab of the main menu so Im going to click agree and now its going out to look for the sound support free wireless earbuds so Im going to go ahead and open up the case and I am going to take both out you need to take both out of the case I am dropping down as its suggested and now its saying select an accessory Im gonna click on the device and now it is connected so just to show you as well if you go into settings Bluetooth and there it is its connected and so you dont have to worry about pairing the app does it automatically for you and well put these down here for a moment so think lets make things easy were downloading an update to your product would you like us to notify you when its ready to install and you could say notify me or no thanks oh say notify you and there you go so you got the battery indicator for the earbuds youve got your volume control here which is nice that you can control it from the earbuds or you could do it from the app and then youve got the Bluetooth logo here are bits of information and controlling of the device so you can change the the name if you want to change the name you can click surprise me so you can do that and have a little fun there you can do the product tour and it will show you in highlight the features and this would do the same thing if youre going to do this within an Android device you have connections so you could connect to multiple devices you have the auto timer so it would automatically shut off when you are not using the sound support free you can even change it to never if you dont want to ever turn it off and then you have voice prompts so you have the ability to turn that off turn it on prompt language all the different languages that you could see you could set it to your language you got your user manual so which is great its smart you know need a book and everything is right here for you if you should have any questions for example how do I check the headphone battery level you can click on that and then it gives you a description right here with images so Bose did a very very good job product info so you got all that information there and again lots of great detail disconnect and then if you press on that top left icon you could find my buds introducing find my buds and you could see where they were last found so very cool feature product help so quick tips how do I find my lost earbuds how long did the headphones take to charge how long does the charging case take so very very cool there and it shows here takes up to two hours to fully charge that the case a full charge of the case allows you to charge your headphones up to two times when the case is battery is fully charged all five battery indicators below solid white so you got some information there again lots of great details all in here terms and condition and all that great stuff so you can see there is a lot of information that you can do within the app and control as well of these fantastic earbuds as far as the connection goes with the Bluetooth and the phone it works very well as soon as you do take the earbuds out of the casing it will then connect to your device and it will also give you an indicator in your ear to let you know that it is now connected unless you turn off that feature where you would not hear that voice telling you that its connected so you have the ability to easily connect to your phone when you put them back in the case you can see it is now not connected so its

and we made a previous solo three wireless fake vs real video were gonna link it up here and today were doing a studio three Wireless fake versus real this came in from a customer and we had to break the bad news to them that hey the item you sent to us is counterfeit and these are the reasons why and we want to educate you guys so you guys can make better purchasing decisions of course the best thing is to make sure you buy from a known source you can buy from us you can buy from other big companies that have a good reputation on selling authentic unions you can check out our website jiuge calm for all your electronics needs were gonna go through a couple of quick steps and how you can tell if your beats are fake or real now that the beats have the w1 chip install thats actually super simple to check all you have to do is power on your beats you hold it for about three seconds and your lights are going to start flashing once they flash go ahead and take your mobile device put it right next to you and turn make sure your blue suits on and itll actually connect with the w1 chips showing your studio three oscillating in a circle Ill also show the color of your item and because of that you know its a legit pair thats a really simple easy way because thats a w1 chip big ones will not have that and because of that you will know for a fact that you have a legitimate pair just because your beats have a serial number does not mean that youre authentic they are mimicking at a legitimate serial number and the household database and its been replicated many times and these factories are smart they do that and we want to show you guys a couple quick distinct differences if you look here at the headband just looking at the color its very distinct you can tell the difference that this one is definitely darker than the authentic the authentic one is here this is the counterfeit pair you also look at the beats logo the color is completely off this is specifically for the shadow gray region a couple of quick color comparisons the hinges are a nice shiny gold if you look over here theyre kind of just it looks like they put a little sticker over the top of it and its not really the best alright more importantly than all of this is really whats going on on the inside of your headphones whats going on in the inside of your headphones so we have a couple parts would like to compare and show you guys so these this is an authentic studio a threepart its black here has all the technology you need as the power capabilities to make sure your city trees are functioning properly here is an aftermarket one the insides are different thats what youre paying for you pay for a technology that beats making and theres an aftermarket board right here its really crappy quality its kind of feeling you very quickly and its not going to function properly not like in studio is supposed to sound so we have the two power boards right here this is the more important more this is a Bluetooth board this is where the w1 chip is located the Bluetooth board has all the magic in there to make it connect to your film better you have better streaming youre not gonna have any interruptions and it also makes sure that you have a significantly longer lasting battery this ship is works a lot of magic and the aftermarket ones that counter the ones are not going to have this chip which is going to allow for you to have a really shitty sound experience I had batteries batteries theyre all pretty similar in general but this is what Im nothing beats battery sounds like this is what the aftermarket beats Donnie looks like not sounds like alright and we wanted to show you guys a matte black there so this is a fake mount black outside panel this is a real matte black outside panel even looking at the logo you can definitely tell the difference and that is something significant just to keep in mind beats is gonna make high quality stuff thats we dont make it if they dont make high quality stuff theyre not gonna have a lot of customers so they want to make sure that they have the best quality product and theyre gonna use the best package they can and with an authentic headband if you look at a headband you take a legitimate part of here and if you take and put on some kind of floor level you should be able to take it and put it all the way down to the ground like that bounce back up thats how you know how you have a high quality part if you buy some shitty part off eBay for our third of the price of an authentic part you do that its gonna snap right in half so thats how you know that youre using authentic beats dont do that she beats dont bend them like this bad idea youre gonna rip something break something but if you have a separate part like this thing for you to try that out and if youre doing on the ebay part dont try now just return that thing make sure you find an authentic part and thats really what youre paying for is an authentic part highquality parts yeah the internals that are really good you have all the sound quality thats built in there and everything seems to work properly alright folks hope that helps you

and bright highs so my expectations are high now they do run off of bluetooth 42 the active noise cancellation theyre saying is so good that youre gonna have your own personal oasis of quiet nice you know I love a good carrying case fantastic very nice heavy duty feels pretty solid ooh those are nicelooking add an extended 18 months to your warranty all right so we got a couple cables here weve got about a 4foot USB to micro USB cable and about a 5 foot 35 millimeter cable so you can go wired or wireless which is always good okay first off Oh while these feel really nice these feel premium oh man these arent gonna go wearing out on you in five minutes thats for sure Wow look at that thats super cushy that feels like memory foam almost now of course you can do this so you can store it away for safe for safe travel its got a 90 degree swivel supersoft protein ear pad it feels very high quality for sure it does not feel cheap in any way wow I really like that ergonomic headband which you can tell its got a very nice cushion on the top I like that thats a good its a good squeeze its a real good squeeze theyre saying that the materials used ensure minimum weight and maximum comfort for long term where its plastic but it doesnt feel cheap so they got the extension right there very nice these feel really good feels like the one of the best feeling headphones Ive had in my hands in a while alright so right here it looks like you got the power switch for the ANC as you can see the blue light turned on youve got your 35 millimeter jack right there so you can plug it in and hardwire it on the right ear Cup youve got the micro USB port for charging and you have your basic control so pause play forward back wheres the microphone dont tell me theres no microphone theres got to be a microphone okay so the microphone is so the microphone is over here thats what theyre saying I dont know I dont see it maybe its in the crack or something oh wow lets try them on though oh yeah oh I like these a lot oh theyre not really big but they cover the ear nice and comfortably that protein leather that protein right there its so cushioning its so soft I dont see my ears getting sore at all from these all these feels really nice alright lets flip on that anc so I can hear central air flowing I can hear fans going as soon as I turn on the ANC this white the time suey and Brian from Family Guy went to the multiverse and they went to the allwhite universe yeah thats thats what Im seeing in my head right now as Im hearing this this is crazy thats really good alright turn that off all right so Im gonna power it on power on youre supposed to say pairing oh there we go okay so it doesnt even say pairing mode it just goes straight into it so there we go the taotronics TTB h20 too Music its got some good sound but flip the ANC on wait a minute whoa when I turn the EampC on the sound it sound like it got more powerful very weird yeah it got a lot its like a little bit louder alright so and see usually when I hit the ANC while Im listening to music it usually has like an adverse effect toward the music this time it didnt it actually sounded like it kind of boosted the power of the music just a little bit very interesting okay lets just see what its got in a bass Department its a very smooth excuse me excuse me its a very smooth bass I dont know if I would call it powerful its very good its very well equalized uh I hand it to them is pretty well equalized for sure they werent lying about that but powerful bass but I think powerful bass I think something thats gonna like like like shake my brain you know Ive expect Ive experienced some of those I wouldnt say powerful I would say vibrant its vibrant it is a vibrant bass for sure and vibrance is not bad thats not a bad thing but powerful bass all right lets uh lets test some quality very clear all right Im gonna do a distance test Ill be right back all right um I went outside to the supermarket I wish I never really lost signal there was a slight jitter but I went like 50 feet very good connection and I gotta say clarity wise amazing amazing very very good okay lets make a phone call call my boy Nathan hey yeah work Ill make it quick Im testing out some headphones how do I sound do I sound like Im on some under I sound like Im just talking to you is normal on the phone big plus yeah you sound pretty good too all right man I dont wanna take up in your time you want you want to say hi to the junkies okay well there we go phone call was really good Nathan said that I sounded like I was talking on on a phone which thats always a plus super comfortable they fit perfectly around my ears these these are very comfortable shake test real quick not happening okay I love the cushion on here its minimal because you see its not real thick and its and its not real wide its it only goes to a certain point but thats all you need you dont need a whole bunch of extra big stuff very low profile with the big sound you can use that taotronics low profile with big sound I really like a very simple interface easy to use a and C and very functional ANC highs and mids absolutely great give him a 9 out of 10 theyre really really good very Chris very clear bass Im gonna give them the same powerful bass I cant agree with that and you know because theyre labeling it as powerful bass change it to vibrant bracelet Ill give it a 9 but for now Im gonna give it an 8 and thats and thats because it sounds really really good definitely suggest checking them out if 70 is in your price range and youre looking for some thats got probably 100 sound quality to it counter Onix has got it its pretty good Ill leave a link down below as usual but I leave it in your hands you guys go check it out for yourself but as for now get out of here", "video_title": "Wireless Headphones with Awesome ANC", "video_comment_count": "3150", "video_dislike_count": "860", "video_view_count": "138790",

guys Im Jeff Rizzo from rizz nose Calm subscribers you know that if youre not a subscriber make sure to subscribe because youre gonna love this channel we do a lot of cool stuff and today were gonna talk about what I think my case for the best wireless headphones under 100 so we do a lot of reviews on this channel but one thing I dont think weve done enough of is best lists and we specifically havent focused on more affordable items so I really want to talk to you about what I think what my opinion is regarding the best ones that are under 100 bucks make sure to hit that thumbs up button if you enjoy the video and found it helpful lets get to it Applause okay so first up in my opinion the best wireless headphones you can v for under 100 are the beats X Wireless so yes I know youre gonna say this theyre 150 dollars well yeah they are thats their MSRP but we find them every single day or at least every week for under 100 Ill link them down below in the description so you can check them out for yourself but my point here is that you can get one hundred and fifty dollar headphones for 99 dollars as long as you shop at the right time or look for a deal and these headphones are awesome our good friend Brian Oliver who runs a limo company worse than every single day we see him all the time and he just raised about these headphones I personally have tested them Ive reviewed them and theres a heck of a lot to like so they are around the neck headphones theyre a little bit longer and then a magnet together so its really convenient to grab them they do have fast fuel charging as well which means five minutes of charging gets you two hours of playback so if youre on the go you can charge them for five minutes youre getting a two hours worth of battery life and then on top of that they have about eight hours on a single charge so you charge them up you get about eight hours of listening time I think the audio quality is pretty good as well and if youre an iOS user they sync seamlessly with your iOS account and its really easy to set up on top of that because the cord is a little bit longer and they have that inline remote and mic it puts up a little closer to your face so you get a nice crisp signal when youre talking to somebody on the phone and thats really important if youre using everyday headphones like the beats X Wireless so I think 50 dollar headphones youre getting for like 99 bucks check our website out or check our deals app out thats a completely free iOS and Android app we dont sell the stuff we just find them 100 best deals of the day subscribers you know this so check that stuff out when you get a chance yeah I think the beats X Wireless are awesome headphones now if I was gonna say the best workout headphones though that are wireless and theyre under 100 Im gonna go jaybird X threes these are headphones Ive used personally for over a year I use them every single day and yes they have an MSRP of 130 dollars but I find it for 99 bucks on a weekly basis so check that out as well again youre getting 130 headphones theyre 99 bucks Im kind of cheating here but Id rather look at the actual prices rather than the MSRP so these headphones I think have a really good fit you can wear them over your ear which is a little bit more of a sporty design that means that the cable is strung up against your head and theres no bounce in the cable basically what it means is it eliminates any annoyance from having a cable next to your head so I love the X 3s for that fact you can also wear them in the traditional under ear design for phone calls for things like that they do come with different ear tips and ear fins they even come with the comply ear tips which are foam and those are awesome its a little offputting at first but theyre great for sound isolation and theyre really great for increasing the audio quality and youre really getting no audio bleed so those check those out theyre also completely sweat proof Ive worn them in the shower absolutely no issues and the battery life is actually better than what chambered States so they say like eight hours Ive had them go nine hours plus and obviously that depends on your volume level but still the battery life is really good on the X threes my biggest downside with these headphones is the fact that they use a proprietary charging cable which means if they do die on you you have to use that charging cradle you cant just use like a standard microUSB or something like thats why it kind of sucks but Im sure it helps with like the waterproofing now one thing they have over most headphones out there is that they have a completely customizable EQ setting so you can change your personal sound preferences any time you want within that jaybird app so I have a custom sound preference that I use for like country or classic and it makes the music sound better to me so you can adjust things like the bass the mids as well as the highs so thats one thing that jbird has that very few other companies have youll see them have three different sound signatures but youll rarely see a company that allows you to adjust everything so if you love rap music you may want to adjust the bass all the way up so thats one thing that I really like about jbird now if I was gonna choose a budget pair of headphones and I know I set headphone spot I mean earphones like most people use earphones Im gonna go with the anchor sound bud slim plus which are the earphones that Im wearing right now itd be kind of odd if I was wearing some others Im earphones I really like these things I mean there are 30 bucks Ive seen them as cheap as 25 again Ill link them down below in the description they are incredibly comfortable they do come with different ear fins and ear tips so they have three different sizes that you can choose from on top of that they have the magnetic earbuds so when you want to wear them around your neck so theyre great for all day carry and theyre great for the gym as well because they are IP x5 certified which means that theyre water resistant and sweat resistant and youre not gonna have an issue there the audio quality is pretty decent they do have three different sound signatures its nothing to write home about but the audio quality is pretty good for 30 headphones one thing I dont like about these earphones is that theyre kind of a little bit on the larger end they stick out from your ear quite a bit so its not like it really matters it does increase the wind noise with the headphones like if youre biking or something youll get a little bit more wind noise it doesnt really bother me but it kind of protrudes quite a bit so if youre petits maybe law pudding for you and look I dont want to dwell on these things then act like theyre their greatest headphones ever I mean theyre 30 bucks but for 30 dollars I really dont think youre gonna be disappointed I think theres some of the best earphones that you can get on Amazon on a budget so let me know what you think though like genuinely have you tried out these earphones do you like them do not like them have you tried out any of the earphones or headphones on this list let me know and Ill see you guys in the next video have a great day Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music", "video_title": "Best Wireless Headphones Under 100  Cheap Earbuds UPDATED",

phone here very soon maybe today maybe tomorrow I dont know Im going to be reviewing it very soon but Ankur sent me these about a week ago but Ive been pretty busy and I havent gotten around to it but Im glad and do it now these are the anchors sound bud slim one of the things that kind of encouraged me to make this video was I was at Walmart yesterday and apparently a lot of the things I make videos on anchor now has at Walmart available at least here in Kansas City if some people are telling me or my Twitter where I posted the tweet the Walmart stuff that they dont have any of their local Walmart so just them look out some of these things you can actually go by your local Walmart and joining has to order from Amazon so thats pretty awesome anchors making it pretty big out there so weve got a pouch with the stuff in it some extra little ear size things and while lots of them actually and then weve got the little tiny itsybitsy charger to charge them up and then we have the instruction booklet which what I uh get stuck and cant quite figure something out so in here it looks like its a little clip actually there you go this one is for those of us with different sized ear holes you have a lot to choose from there look at that a tiny a medium and the extra little extra large and then if you prefer a different style one theyve got these as well so mammy or this this goes on no matter what actually but theyve got two sizes in here this is kind of cool they give you lots of options to choose from as far as the size of your ear and the size of the whole inside you or your ear canal or whatever so thats awesome look at that alright the actual earbuds are in here lets take a look at these I sell these at Walmart and I was like hey I have those I just havent used them yet look at that look at that thats awesome and it comes with one on there right away so actually theres like four different sizes for those of you with different sized ears and then three sizes for the like clip it goes around your ear and then weve got some volume up volume down like a playpause answer mute like a universal all in one button and Oh a little charging port right there to go ahead and charge this sucker up so lets go ahead and just see what happens when I plug in a charger and then turn the hook read a sucker for ever its a little banged up lets see what happens here little red light comes on right there letting it so its charged there is another light next to it it might be the one that turns on when its fully charged up not quite sure at the moment lets go ahead and turn these on Im assuming just this would be the power button if its not on yep okay so that little red lights now blue and its pulsing lets know its searching so lets go in our settings here sound bud slim right away pair it up a little light solid now can be used for call and audio or call for calls and sound thats pretty cool and then lets go ahead put these around her ear all right the default ones actually fit me quite well Ill go ahead and get a little frontfacing camera view of myself you can see my ugly mug I do apologize the normal ones actually fit quite well and I know you will be able to hear this obviously but Im just going to go ahead and play something for me to listen to all right lets assume this song good old song here thats quite nice actually sell out to get and does have an independent volume over here they actually have their own independent volume it doesnt show up on the phone when you turn it up oh my thats loud actually quite hurt that hurts okay that hurts actually its got its own independent volume so turn it up all the way on here or most of the way and then turn it up and down as you want it on the headset like that would you like that somethings getting in the way somethings just about to break I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane all that these things sound great and they are extremely loud to the point where they actually can do ear damage probably if you listen to them at their loudest volume for a while I will have a link to these in the description if you want to purchase one of these for yourself or you can just go to your local Walmart if they have them like mine does and pick these up they sound great this is all it is hanging from your neck theres no extra cables theyre not huge ones that go on

earbuds now you can pick these up on Amazon Ill put a link up in the description the price on these 200 bucks now Ive been getting a lot of requests to check these out so lets check them out lets go through the features youve got legendary clip sound you getting bluetooth 50 with aptX and AAC youve got 8 hours worth of battery on a single charge with an additional 24 hours using a charging case so thats a total of 36 hours now these also feature quick charts so if you put them in the case for 15 minutes you get two hours with the playtime now the ipx4 splashresistant youve got four mics for phone calls and you got access to Google or Siri now alright so all of that for 200 bucks lets see what it is first things first shout out the white shoes back in the building white shoes calm down alright here we go clips t5 true wireless earbuds lets see did we miss anything alright true wireless earphones with the charging case sweat resistant patented oval ear tips for ultimate comfort and excellent seal for noise isolation so hes got the oval tips legendary detailed and dynamic clip sound for mics with clear voice chat eight hours battery 20 flaws with the case pretty much let me grab a little unboxing knife got the incredible home today look at that little seal I like that alright thats nice wrap here we go all right my bad yeah I forgot to put my phone on solid here we go okay inside got a nice presentation alert alright lets see thats your usual books and  __  plug them in follow me okay now check out this charging case oh now this is 100 aluminium you feel that cold steel this case is mad heavy I like that already USB types are type C charging on the back okay now these will flap open heres what it is heres the air buds now one thing I gotta say Im not too big on the clips Brandon on the air buds like that I like mines to be a little bit more discreet well hey if youre a big Clips fan then you want everybody to know you got the clips joints it is what it is now check these out these are the oval tips so clips claims like these are gonna be the most comfortable ear buds on the market because of these oval tips shoes school scoop lets drop them in the case and see how they fit okay thats one and theres your other one okay so these are charging up you see you got some LEDs inside the case lets do the shake test and see if these pop out easy okay good so they dont fall out root too easily lets see what else you get in here okay USB typec charging cable I shoes handle that lets see this is USB typec to USB a alright thats a nice touch and some different sized ear chips and thats pretty much it alright now let me do the smell test on these and they smell like quality all right 200 bucks thats what you expect I gotta say this one more time this might be the heaviest charging case that Ive seen yet matter of fact let me pull out my favorite charging case the master and dynamics mwo 7 this is also steel case aluminum steel whatever you want to call it lets see yeah the clips is definitely a little bit heavier and it looks a little bit nicer because you see how this one got all scratched up this one kind of looks like brushed aluminium so maybe gonna get less scratches on this one alright so let me pause the video I grab a phone will pair these up and then we start the usual testing talk amongst yourselves alright guys well be back in now I got these all paired up so now lets test them out now for the pairing process real simple once you take them out of the case theyll automatically power up and therell be a bluetooth pairing mode go your phones bluetooth menu and select the T files next as far as the look like I said I could do without the clips Brandon but they dont look bad at all these are supposed to be the most comfortable and I will say this they are super comfortable let me slap them back in my ears now if you look closely they are right and left branded so let me put them back in like I said yeah the fit is very comfortable let me adjust them correctly and do my head shake test alright Ill start with 50 shake each okay now theyre wobbling a little bit but they havent fallen out yet lets do 75 shaking okay look all right that was 75 shaking and the left one popped out now look this little coneshaped design on it they dont really fit your ears too snug so if youre gonna be doing heavy activities running working out these might not be the ones these will be perfect for sitting at your desk maybe catching a flight somewhere doing your usual commute but as you seen for yourself 75 shake it they pop right out and you put them back in alright now this is how youre gonna look in your ears not bad at all but like I said Im just not a fan of the Brandon but thats for you to be the judge of now most importantly how do they sound lets grab some music alright so I got some Lisa Lisa I wonder if I take you home queued up were gonna try this at max volume one tap for playing pause let me grab my mic even though I promise yall Im not gonna sing I want to be prepared here we go Birdman hands rubbing together lets get it on okay theyre definitely loud nice noise isolation okay all right I thought to feel something od sound good I do definitely sound good I know youre wondering why I wont go over to your place Im not too sure how so I rather go at my own pace if we get together emotions will start over I may do something I might regret the next day when I now look I got to keep a real job these are super comfortable I even though theyre not for sports right there was an advertised for sports so these aint gonna be the best for the gym but if youre doing like Im doing right now just sitting at your table at work sitting on the bus sitting on the train sitting on that flight the level of comfort or knees is amazing now I will say another thing Im having a little problem that one side keeps cutting out like the left hair but kind of keeps cutting out so Im gonna pause the video Im gonna play a few more songs and do a little bit more testing but I dont like that I so far the Bluetooth connection Im gonna try a different phone also see if we can make this work unpaired Im and repair them again but sound quality wise sound quality wise yeah I like these I dont like these alright so let me uh let me try something else real quick hold up alright so check this out not just paired these up to three different phones Id use my iPhone I got a one plus seven pro right here and Im having the same problem the left ear bud keeps cutting in and out now heres our Bluetooth 50 I havent done my full connection test yet but sitting right in front of the phone the connections should be super stable but its not its cutting in and out now in a side note the sandy review unit you see for yourself I copies directly from clips so these are the ones that youre gonna get so as of right now maybe I got a defective unit maybe I dont but I gotta call it like I see it the connection status is trash alright the left ear bud keeps going in and out right up my favorite parts of the song the left side disappears and then it comes back on nevertheless lets do some more testing alright so first lets start off with the connection test Im gonna walk 30 feet and then 50 feet and see if these cut in and out and on the side note Im a little bit disappointed because the sound quality or NEADS is pretty good alright theyre nice and loud mad highs and mids not the most bass heavy but theyre super loud and the headphones are comfortable I like them but I cant rock with the no connection but lets put it to the test alright so Im gonna put hit playing pause let me start what Ill start walking around alright here we go Im walking away Music nope nope Oh New Yorker collective property playing but not believe ha ha all right hold up okay all right now look I walked 30 feet I got a set up I got a set up I got a market so I walked 30 feet and it was fine as soon as I got the 35 feet I was trying to do my 50 feet chest 35 feet it was a rep both of them started cutting in and out then when I got back to 30 came back on I started walking back to the table the left side went out again so I might have a defective pair maybe I do maybe I dont but so far the connection on these trash all right trash sound quality Im feeling it Im feeling the sound quality Im feeling the comfort level but the connection nah nah its not a go lets keep it moving all right so check this out now if you notice on the bottom it says clips t5 true Wireless right like its connected to the right side even though its playing out of both sides so when I go over to my bluetooth menu same thing it says right theres only one clips theres no theres no left side theres only one clips in the menu so when I connect to it the right side is connected then it automatically connects to the left side so I dont know maybe they need to do an update or something but as of right now the connection is real spotty on this one just keep it moving all right so now lets do the one ear blood test can you play music from one side while other side is in the charging case here we go so I got the music playing Im gonna take out the left side lets drop it in the case close it up okay see it just disconnect it it said ready to pair now lets see if I could pair up the right side okay this clips t5 right I said device paired take it back to the music okay now the right side is connected now I got music come from the right side all right so lets put the left side back in wait for it to connect okay the left side just connect it now Im gonna take out the right side drop it in the case close it up take just disconnect it waiting okay didnt get anything okay now its a device paired not just connected to the left lets hit the music okay so the left side is playing so you can play these either a out of town alright so now lets check the button controls one tap on the right side for playing pause okay no problems with that thats also gonna answer and your phone calls okay double tap on the right side to skip to the next zone okay no problems with that long press on the right side to increase your volume okay no problems with that now for the left side one tap by activate your Siri or your Google whats the weather for tomorrow okay no problems with that double tap to reverse tracks okay no problems our debt and long press for volume damn okay no problems with that all the button controls work alright so now lets check the call quality call up my daughter see what it is I just running out of both ears lets get max volume yeah what up what youre doing alright well Im doing my usual Im testing out some headphones how do I sell guys sound clear sound good alright let me let me whisper the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog did you hear me oh come on man right in my ear come on bro come on bro yeah I heard that thats the sound quality of your burps I good good good alright well anyway Im a guy let me wrap this video up yo you know tomorrow night this on we got to get our fits together alright so lets get busy but are we going boom status I guess I was gonna ask you the same thing but I was about to say you not about that bum life alright so listen now lets lets bump it out so this way we could go in and be fat asses yeah I Im sneaking the Dominos pizza up in there lets get it on alright well Im going back in a minute all right back ok cool quality or knees it sounded pretty good she said I sounded clear she sounded clear to me but the issue Im having is while Im on the phone call same thing the left ear bud is going in and out the right one started cutting out a little bit the Bluetooth connection on this real suspect I call quality sounded good but the connection is just pretty suspect I got to look into that a little bit more lets keep it moving alright so now lets check for lag latency and what I mean by that is when youre watching a video is there any delay from the persons lips to what you hear so Im just gonna hit play on this Im gonna watch a little YouTube first and well see your the connection on this okay minimum lag maybe just a little fraction of a second not bad at all I could definitely watch a movie like this all day lets try Netflix alright so let me try a little Netflix got some dave chappelle lets see okay Netflix no lag at all this is perfect no the connection no the connection is going in and out again ah lets keep it moving alright so Im about to rage quit with these earbuds but before I do that I wanted to make sure I covered every base so I just reset my iPhone I disconnected the Bluetooth I repaired them again Im gonna try to listen to one more song and see if I dont get any cutouts now all through this video all of my testing everything Ive been doing theyve been cutting in and out so lets try this one last time lets get max volume okay the song started off right Im gonna just pop my head normally whoo okay now let me move back a little bit okay right now its running good right now its running good oh hes sound good though its really sound good lets give it one minute lets see if you could go one minute without a cutout okay all right all right let me let me pause it hold up okay so I gotta say this the sound quality Ernies is excellent all right now like I said theyre not the most bass heavy in the world if you compare them to some power beats Pro no I the power beats Pro got way more bass these are more of a balanced sound but the volume level these get really loud and theyre super comfortable and I already said that but I gotta stress it these are super comfortable you can easily wear these all day my biggest concern is the bluetooth connection now theyre supposed to come out with an app for these maybe when they come with that when theyll come out with an update or something Im in the early stages with these right now the Bluetooth connection is my biggest gripe every test that I did so far while Im doing the testing in and out so I just reset my phone repaired them again I havent seen them cut out yet let me pause the video all right because I want to give you out my honest opinion Im gonna pause the video Im gonna play ten songs right Im gonna smoke and play ten songs and by the time I finish Ill let yall know if they cut in and out one more time here we go alright so overall on a scale of one to ten I cannot cosign these ear buds and Im gonna tell you why the sound quality is pretty good now if youre looking for loud ear buds these get super loud like volume levels very loud theyll definitely drown out or your outside noise as far as the music crystal clears with the mids and the highs the bass is okay alright its not super bass if youre looking for super bass you gotta go with the power beats pro but the bass is nice no mud involved I dont really got no complaints with the sound quality and like I said they get very loud the charging case is beautiful I love the stainless steel build I only like the mw7 is a little bit better because they have a little bit more shine to it but I love the charging case USB typec bluetooth 50 so this kind of futureproof battery life eight hours on a single charge 36 hours total thats amazing no lag when youre watching your Netflix videos maybe a fraction of a second when you watch in YouTube but thats nothing you could easily live with that no complaints phone calls they sound pretty good I heard the person out of both ears she heard me fine no qualms with that you can use these one ear but at the time I love that feature but the reason why I cant cosign these hair buds is because of the bluetooth connection the Bluetooth connection is trashed now let me say this I tried every possible fix I paired these up to three different phones same problem I reset the phone reset the air buds deleted them repaired them tried everything I could do I tried all my different music streaming services SoundCloud Apple music Pandora you to read every different music service that I played I had the same problem and one of the main problems is when you switch tracks every time you switch to the next track the air buds cut out now first it was just the left ear but cutting out I reset everything set them up again then the right side started cutting now then every time you start getting comfortable into your music maybe after 23 minutes go by you switch songs then its tough to cut out again and this is me sitting right in front of the table now yeah I see when I did the range test as soon as I passed 30 feet you lost connection so the Bluetooth connectivity on these is trash now clips supposed to come out with an app thats gonna give you access to and eat you and all that maybe theyre doing update and fix that connection well see as of right now I cant cosign these bodies at your own risk Im personally gonna keep them because the level of comfort these are definitely one of the most comfortable earbuds on the market I love the comfort feeling these now look these are not advertised as sports earbuds so if you take them to the gym you start doing back flips and all that theyre gonna plop out all right theyre gonna fall out easily but if youre sitting at your desk you want your earbuds to be super comfortable youre not really moving around I can easily rock these for for 8 hours with no ear fatigue I did super lightweight and they just feel nice and it is I love that little cone shape design thats why Im kind of disappointed with these because the sound quality and the build and the battery everything is a go except for the Bluetooth connection and thats gonna get on your nerves just trust me all right Im back here doing my chest in every time I start grooving into one of my songs at my favorite part of the song Im reciting the lyrics boom it cuts out thats gonna get on your nerves and for 200 bucks you dont want that now you dont want that so I would say if you really like these hold off wait till they come out with an app once they come out with the app Ill do an updated video like I said I cant cosign these I just cant I cant do it I dont want to tell you how to go and get these and Ill be looking at me like Im trying to sell you got some trash dont do it to yourself wait and I say wait on these or get something else now if youre a big Clips fan and you want to buy these just know that like I said they coming out with an app so maybe in the future theyll fix that lets all go to the clips website and lets all spam them and tell them they need to fix that because the sound quality is worth it like the sound quality would be worth it for 200 bucks anyway clip ste fobs like I said I cant cosign these bodies at your own peril

JBL tune 500 bluetooth wireless headphones and its a part of a series of budget headphone reviews because theres only so much money I can spend on gear until they increase teacher pay okay pure bass were gonna find out pure bass sound handsfree calls multipoint connection lightweight and foldable design five minute charge equals an hour of listening time alright sixteen hour battery shiny micro USB thats really on there paperwork well look at these later they are really lightweight really like weve got some kind of its definitely not leather has foam on the inside padding seems like it might be comfortable they fold here its pretty basic volume buttons probably track skip buttons power and pairing microUSB ear pads are soft these fill a little kitty they feel a little childlike but okay so Im gonna go and pair these up and listen for a little while and Ill come back and let you know what I think on second thought I think Im gonna let you watch me react to how they sound Music okay that was Simon Says by making the stallion so sexual healing by Marvin Gaye I would like to hear a lot more of the guitar the guitar is really in the background and its one of the better sounding parts of that song so okay to be fair these headphones boast themselves as being pure bass so Im gonna play my favorite EDM song and its be to you by boombox cartel so lets see if the bass holds up Music so lets first talk about the quality to build quality okay they were 4999 so I dont expect them to feel premium but I am afraid to stretch them too far I feel like if I go any further than this theyre gonna pop the phone was comfortable I really dont like on ear headphones I like for the faux headphone to clear my ears just more comfortable after a while with having my glasses on I felt that they were squeezing my ear onto my glasses that was uncomfortable now this is gonna be kind of nitpicky but I would rather the power button be here and the volume controls be here because one time I hit the power button and held it until I turned the headphones off and I was trying to change the volume but other than that its there okay sound quality for the price point I think they sound really good if youre looking for I like weight pair of headphones if youre not at ear buds kind of person you want headphones for the gym or what have you these will work fine if your kids need headphones to do online work at home or what have you theyre great the bass bass was crisp again Ive heard better but not for this price so I definitely recommend checking these out Ill put the link in the

these are me em eh yeah 80 bucks I suppose but for 80 bucks nah Id rather spend an extra couple of dollars and get those are ghosts EXO drops which is a little bit disappointed to me because unlike soul candy headphones I saw him like skull candy head yall already know when it comes to bass the Skullcandy question 360s theres nothing like it on the market right those will blow you away these Im not really blown away let me take it to one more song let me just make sure its not the song lets take it over to uh we got some Sierra now this song I got it on Apple music so its gonna be nice and loud ya hear it alright here we go okay okay yeah all right now this sounds a little bit better okay yeah okay now let me let me rephrase that I mean I got to make a new rating I said they was a man they not men theyre actually good not great but good now thats the thing sometimes when youre playing YouTube music its low quality you know its not really produced to the maximum sound taking over Apple music this is gonna be high quality high quality streaming it does sound a little bit better but again for 80 bucks I dont know like I said I mean if you want to take budget I suppose but I was rival rather spend an extra couple of dollars and get something that youre gonna be a little bit more happy about now why we here why we here no edit in the lab lets test the assess the phone calls out let me cool let me pull up i know yall already know what Im looking for let me take it over to the 24hour diner find out what time they closed shut up  white shoes she dont be trying to hear me sing but it is what it is I said we call I Atlantic diner see what time they closed okay yeah here it is ringing yeah hi we time you guys closed tonight okay great thanks a lot okay now for the phone calls crystalclear you can hear the person out of both is no problems with that sound quality they are loud if yall noticed I was talking a little bit louder the sound quality they are loud you can hear the bass but its not that clean clean bass it kind of sounds a little bit muddy a little bit on the money side let me bring it back one more time yeah yes a little a little bit on the muddy side these would be perfect for a little kid perfect with some throwaway headphones but if you planning on taking a flight somewhere or youre gonna rock these at work all day everyday I would say invest a couple of dollars more and get something a little bit better now if youre looking for that lastminute Christmas gift lastminute Christmas gift you cant go wrong with these nobodys gonna complain a set of wireless headphones that do actually work now I just want to test one more thing one more thing let me uh I got one more song they got a lot of bass here we go not bad Im trying not to be too harsh or knees cuz there are only 80 bucks they not bad they not bad the reason I might be a little bit biased also because today I was rocking me off I was rocking the skull candy crush your wireless is earlier so I had that bass pounding in my ears so to go from that to these you notice the difference immediately I give these a number on a scale of 1 to 10 Id give these a solid six to six and a half alright they definitely not a seven definitely not eight they I ride AI anyway scroll candy crushing hash three special requests video whoever that was that hit me up asked me to check these out like I said if you want to tight budget then get these but for 80 bucks save one more paycheck I understand you want to listen to your music right now save one more paycheck and get something a little bit better not to mention the build quality on these not gonna like now they all lightweight but youre not gonna like them they kind of feel cheap and plasticky and they look at this this is how its gonna be on your head they dont stretch that much so when you put them on your head they feel tight now I got a big head ladies but still thats not the point they a little bit too tight most headphones stretch a lot more than these they dont stretch that much but if you look on my some low budget headphones check these out anyway Skullcandy question has three hit me up in the comments let me know

jbird xforce and in the process were gonna be comparing them to the axe 3s well be talking about whats new the good the bad the ugly all that stuff if you do enjoy the video and you find it helpful make sure to give us a thumbs up maybe subscribe to the channel huh Ill see you in a second all right so lets first start by talking about whats new with the jbird xforce and as a forewarning some of this stuff is really minor okay so there are seven things to note first they are now ipx7 certified so that means that you can submerge them down to one meter for 30 minutes so it technically means you can swim with them however bluetooth isnt gonna transmit through water so you cant use these for swimming but they are very water resistance you shouldnt be worried at all with how much you sweat or if youre working out you know near a pool or anything like that or if you work out in the rain you do a lot of running in the rain they are completely water resistant down to one meter for 30 minutes which is awesome but I have to be honest Ive not had a single issue related to sweat or water with my X threes or my X twos so its nice to have I dont think its wholly necessary though number two they have softer ear fins slash hooks so some people complained that the hooks on the X 3s were a little too pointy a little bit more of a harsh silicon material now theyre softer you can see that theres a less material and theyre rounded at the edges so they are indeed more comfortable I dont think its a major upgrade though certainly not you know such an upgrade that it warrants an entirely new model but they are nice number three these silicone ear buds that they come with are now conical in shape as opposed to cylindrical and I cant find any practical reason why they did that to me it doesnt make any difference whatsoever if you look at the ones that came with the X threes and the ones come to X fours I have no idea why they made the change but they did it number four there is a tiny change to the charging cable but its not even worth mentioning number five they now have a cord cinch as opposed to the traditional cord management clips which I actually quite liked but when they added this guy they got rid of those cable management clips those are like 10 cents I dont know why they didnt keep those in the box with the X fours but now you have this inch instead of the clips and yeah this thing is cool but youve seen it on every single pair of headphones ever so its not really a feature number six now they technically have a real quick charge feature so it takes ten minutes to get about an hour worth of playback time on the X threes it was about double that so 20 minutes to get an hour worth of playback time number seven they now have jaybird exclusive comply foam ear tips now I really like the foam ear tips I like them on the X threes I really appreciate having them and I those are the ones that I actually use and I would recommend you try those out because theyre really good for a number of reasons I cant really notice a difference between the ones that were on the X threes and now the jaybird exclusive ones on the X force but its cool they kept them and thats it other than that the X fours are the exact same thing as the X threes the same earbud design the same tangle resistant cable the same remote the same mic the same length of the earbuds everything is the same now in my opinion thats not really a bad thing because I really really like the X threes I just think that some of the stuff didnt really warrant jaybird coming out with an entirely new model but thats not up to me so the X 4s are gonna have an MSRP of 130 dollars Ill link them down below in the description thats the same price as what the X 3s retailed for and now naturally the X rays have dropped in price theyre about a hundred dollars so me personally I would probably rather get the X threes at a hundred bucks than the X fours at 130 I dont know you let me know down below in the comments I dont think one hundred and thirty dollars is expensive for headphones but if theyre almost the exact same thing as 2x threes why not save your money but speaking of saving money thats part of what we do we help people save money on some of the coolest products out there every single day we scour the internet for the best 100 deals we post about them we dont sell the stuff we just alerts you that there are awesome deals out there and we have a completely free iOS and Android mobile app that you can check out the link so those are in the description I can just tell you now though jaybird pops up all the time those beats and the list goes on we save people a ton of money but thats enough talk about business comm now lets get back to the review portion of todays video lets start with the design of the X fours the X fours have a tangle resistant cable as I mentioned before which is pretty standard nowadays they do have that cord cinch as I mentioned before thats to shorten up the cable but I personally do really miss having those cable management clips those were kind of the linchpin and being able to wear them in the over ear position which is the more sporty position those allowed you to string the cable up up against the back of your head so when you went running or did some intense workout it didnt bounce all over the place with the cord management cinch it works but it doesnt work as well as those clips and if you take a look at this thing its like it calling all rat tail fans basically it youd have a little rat tail at the end of it and it doesnt really bounce all that much but sometimes if you dont cinch it down properly you can get this thing just going all over the place which can be very annoying so yeah I like having this inch but I wish they would have just thrown in the 2 cent cable management clips as well now the X 4 is also have a full remote and an inline mic the remote is pretty standard Ill link the manual down below in the description so you can read up on the exact controls its the same as the x rays and many other headphones the X 4s are also going to work with Siri Google assistance and theyll work for calls on top of that as for the earbuds themselves they have a pretty minimal size and are sort of contoured to fit comfortably in your ear again Ive used the X 3s for two years now I think theyre really comfortable and I like the way they fit in your ear by default and jaybird is going to have the medium size that your fins and your tips on the x 4s but they also offer other sizes in the box so you can find the right fit for your ear keep in mind though that the ear fins are angled to lock in place in your ear so there is an actual right and left designated side so you cant just put any ear fin on any earbud you have to put the right one on the right one and the left one on the left one thats how you get the best fit as for overall durability well its going to be pretty dang good no issues with them breaking no issues with them being damaged although I dont exactly know how youre gonna use them they are as I mentioned before ipx7 certified which you wont see on hardly any other headphones out there so they are definitely good to go around water around sweat and urine it has to be official and it has to be urine but how do they x4 sound the answer is very good theyre a little flat out of the box but thats on purpose and Ill explain that here in a second they have great passive noise isolation which means that when you put them in your ear you cant really hear things around you which is probably the reason Im talking a little loud right now but you cant cure everything around you which is great for the gym right you dont want to hear that guy over there grunting all day long when hes doing deadlifts you know guy Im talking about he comes in there with his girlfriend he stays on the deadlift squat rack area and hes there for like an hour and he does three reps that guy and he groans and grunts all the time yeah you wont have to hear him which is pretty awesome but the sound isolation is a doubleedged sword while its great for the gym its not so great for running especially if youre running in an urban environment now they do a good job of canceling out the wind noise because you have such good passive noise isolation but if youre in an urban environment like New York or you know something like that you want to be able to hear some of the ambient noise around you as like a safety precaution so you dont get hit by a car and really with the xforce there are no great solution for allowing and more sound I guess you could take one of the earbuds out kind of like put it down your shirt but yeah theres just not going to be great for running in super urban environments or on train tracks now the actual sound preferences themselves are adjustable with an app we saw this I think first show up on the jbird freedoms then the x3 then the run then the freedom  and now the x4 so they have an accompanying app where you can jump in there and you can adjust the entire spectrum of the EQ so you can add more bass take away from the bass add more mids take away from the mids highs all that stuff which is actually really great so if you like this a countrymusic you can customize the x4 to sound how you want them to sound to sound best for that genre of music and not only can you customize the EQ yourself but you can find different presets for different types of music so I customized one it was called get to it and thats the one I use for when Im playing I think its mostly country music that I play so thats the one that sounds best for me for country music but there are plenty of other ones to choose from from professional athletes from jaybird and just other people that have customized their own EQ which is really awesome there arent that many headphones out there that also have this feature so if you do get the exports make sure to download that jaybird app and to kind of play around the sound settings now one other thing in that jaybird app is a find my buds feature which allows you to see where you last pair the x4 s to your Bluetooth device so that way you know if you lose them you can find them obviously thats not a perfect solution but it is kind of clever and it may come in handy every once in a while now for the Bluetooth range it is about 50 feet that is with a clear lineofsight and indoors Im able to walk around our office pretty much no problem once I get past that 50 foot threshold though there is some disruptions to the signal and just as a little tip if you keep the remote facing your Bluetooth device youll get a even longer signal so you can go 75 feet 100 feet but the second you turn around itll cut into that signal but still 50 feet its actually really nice I said this in another video but I can go take a whiz and the music doesnt even cut out which is great now for battery life they have about 9 hours of battery life on a single charge thats our test thats a little bit more than jaybird says theyll do they say about 8 hours but from what Ive been seeing its about 9 hours which is pretty good its not way above average but I guess it would be kind of seven eight hours for wireless headphones and these are these are pretty good plus they have that quick charge feature so as for the verdict on the X fours yes I really do like them I dont think some of the changes were as dramatic as jaybird is gonna say they are but theyre really good headphones that Ive enjoyed testing them I personally am just going to keep my x3 I like them I love them actually and I use them every single day so Ill probably just give these to one of the guys here on the team let me know what you think though Id love to hear your comments down below but be a little respectful because weve had some mean people lately and I dont like that I dont like it at all I have a great day Music Applause Music Applause

"video_id": "B6n5RIuiFOw", "Closed Captions": " Music Applause so a few months back we did a video for you guys on Astros new at the time 810 headphones in fact I think you could probably see the link to that piece that we did right up there now the eight ends were a big deal for a couple of reasons number one its always a big deal when a company like Astra which has been one of the premier of names and gaming headsets for a long time its always a big deal when they put out a new headphone everyone wants to know about it see what its like in all the specs but it was a big deal for another reason as well and thats because it was the first time Astro had a headphone that was priced under 100 in fact the headphone itself was 60 that that wouldnt be a big deal on its own if it wasnt any good but the fact is its a great headphone people love it to this day people still love the a10 its selling really well and a lot of gamers are really happy that they can have the Astro experience at a really really reasonable price point there a lot of you out there that still wanted more youre saying hey I like a wireless gaming headphone and Id like to be priced lower than the 299 that we have to spend for the a 50 Astros flagship wireless headphone well guess what Astra was listening they probably had this in the works for a while and now for everyone that wanted a less expensive but still Astro quality wireless headphone experience the a20 wireless headphone so of course were going to unbox this and share all of its little secrets with you but before that lame unboxing knife come on you knew it was coming I always have to do it all right now while Im unboxing the 820 Wireless let me talk a little bit a big picture about this headphone of course it features the same great astro build quality that all their headphones are known for which is amazing because this particular headphone the wireless 820 only cost 149 dollars but youre still getting that great bill that great quality build that Astra was known for it also promises 15 hours of battery life which is a really big deal because if the battery runs out to you quickly you dont want to have to stop your gaming experience to go plug it in wait for it to charge 15 hours of gameplay should be plenty for all of you if youre getting more than 15 hours at a time you probably have a problem and you talk to somebody Im just trying to make sure youre being healthy the other thing that I thought was really interesting is as I sort of open up the one flap that closes this whole thing when I spoke with fattiest Cooper over at Astro we were talking about all this features of this headphone had he was listening off some bullet points you know all the great features then he said then of course it has all the usual stuff like you know the flip up mic to boom mic thatll mute it and of course the equalizer the EQ that allows you to do preset EQ and you know it allows you to balance the chat between game chat and voice chat all the normal stuff and I have to laugh and I have to stop and I was like you know what that may be normal for Astro headphones but thats not normal for the for all the other headphones these are features that are only normal if youre used to getting Astro headphones these are things that Astro puts in all their new headphones that the competitors still havent caught up with so I love the fact that Astro sort of was downplaying all the really cool features that you dont really get other headphones but of course youre gonna get them at the Astro so those are all here as well you have the boom mic that flips up to mute you have the EQ you can also use Astros command center which will allow you to really customize the sound and itll even allow you to customise the microphone input so people are having trouble hearing you or if theyre hearing you too loudly you can adjust the volume theyre all through software so look what I did okay so out of the box heres what youre greeted with there are two different versions of the Astro 820 wireless headphones theres one that is meant for the PlayStation 4 and theres one that is meant for the Xbox one and I mean the entire Xbox one family of consoles the vs the standard and of course the upcoming Xbox one X cant wait for that to come out now the nice thing is regardless of which model you get the one designed for the PlayStation 4 or the Xbox one both of those models are going to be compatible with PC and Mac as well so these can be headphones for your home console and your computer at the same time here right off the top we see a cable or 2 to 2 cables micro USB cables one a little longer than the other and I assume when we open this up there we go and right off the bat I can tell you theyre nice and light I think when you work when you when you get a wireless headphone you worried that of course all the technology has to be built in the wireless receiver and everything that goes along with that youre worried about it weighing down the headphones these are not heavy at all these are nice and light but as I said earlier they still have that Astro quality of build hopefully you can get a good look here that matte black finish and that classic of course I have the Xbox one edition and you can see the little green on the inside the microphone has a little plastic cover and the microphone you can see is nice and flexible now on the side here you see there is a little red tab Im going to pull that off and on the side here look at this we have the different okay theres a master volume control here theres a little roller wheel right on the bottom corner here that controls the master volume of the headphone and here youll see a little rocker around either side of the master volume switch and that rocker will allow you to balance the audio when youre gaming if you want to hear more if youre playing online with your friends and family and you want to hear more of the chat you can press the button to go more towards chat if you want to hear more ingame sounds and ingame volume you can hit that as well so thats another one of the things that a strobe does that they think is normal but its not normal its a really cool feature and something that all Astro head phones now have okay so moving up from where the master volume is and then where the little rocker switch is to adjust chat versus game audio youll see two buttons here on the side and it looks like a little LED light one of them on the top is for power the one right below right here is actually to adjust the different pre predone eqs that they have they have a few settings that you can choose from at the beginning to sort of tailor the sound to your liking but again you can go into their software a command center and fully to me audio however you like but its nicer they have some preset eqs as well and in terms of the buttons that is pretty much it it has you can tell its built on these sliders you can see how the slider sort of works up and down works pretty smoothly a little rubberized insert on the headband here thats very very comfortable or feels very very comfortable let me see for myself its very very comfortable these are really really comfortable and very adjustable yeah Ive said this a million times and different and different in different reviews for headphones you can have the greatest headphone in the world with all the greatest features you could ever want but if it isnt comfortable youre not going to wear it long enough to appreciate all those features so comfort is something that astro also puts right up there with their legendary sound quality now I have tested the sound of these offcamera I dont want to sit here and have me have the headphones on and listen and have you watch me do that sound quality is excellent but really would you expect anything less from astro Im just blown away you get the great sound quality great build all the great features for pretty much half the price of the a 50 I think thats I think thats amazing and I dont know how quite how they do that okay so lets put the headphone itself down for a second because there is something that makes all the magic happen in terms of the wireless experience and that is the little bass here that are now taking oh its so small look at how tiny this thing is this is the bass okay so moving from left to right on this you have a little toggle switch right here and that toggle switch will allow you to switch it between PC mode and Xbox mode depending on how youre using it then in the middle there is a classic USB port and that actually is going to allow you to plug this USB cable into this and then charge your 820 headphones then you have a optical port yes yeah digital audio port right there optical audio port right there and thats gonna get the sound from your Xbox into the module and then send it to your 828 wireless headphone and then on the very back you will see a micro USB input theres gonna be a typical again a USB cable from your Xbox that goes into the micro USB input here that will give this whole unit power so that should pretty much explain how the Box works and of course all the cables are included the optical audio cable is right here and of course the two micro USB cables here now some of you may be wondering okay whats the difference between this and the big Daddy you know its big brother the a 50 wireless headphone again which is 300 versus this one which is 149 dollars I happen to have the a 50 here and Ill kind of show you first off you can see theres a slight design ethic difference as great as durable as they are these are youll see these have a little bit of a better build quality to them only because you have youll see the the aluminum piping here of course in classic Xbox green youll have the aluminum piping the headset has built a little differently they have the Tempurpedic foam on the headpiece instead of the rubberized material thats on the a20 so there are some differences the build quality is going to be a little better on this one and of course wouldnt you expect a 150 dollar headphone versus a three hundred dollar headphone like this there are going to be some differences in terms of the sound youre still getting great sound on the a20 just a little bit different build quality on this one also on the 850 youll see the u number I told you about the rocker switch on the 820 that adjusts in game chat versus game audio well this does it on the earpiece so a little bit different technology build a little bit fancier on the a 50 the other main difference between the a 50 and the a 20 is while you have to charge the a 20 through this little box and the micro USB cable that I just showed you the a 50 actually has this which along with being larger calls so acts as a cradle which this guy just sits in and charges using the contact points on the bottom because he has little contact points down there so you dont to worry about plugging the sky and just when youre done gaming this gets seated right on here and automatically charges waiting for your next gaming session if you can deal with the fact that the game audio adjustment is in a different position you actually have to plug it in instead of sitting it on its base to get its charge if you can deal with a a still beautifully made and very comfortable headphone but not quite as fancy as the a 50 if you can deal with those differences you can save 150 by getting this headphone or for people that are on a budget that cant afford a 300 headphone 149 dollar headphone of this quality with this great sound is is sort of a huge win for gamers everywhere so if you like hearing about the Astro 820 headphones let us know by giving this video a thumbs up

earphones so you do have replaceable ear tips that do come with the package now like I mentioned these earphones have bluetooth 50 so they will connect with all your latest audio devices along with your smartphones that do support 52 oh and now they deliver a good amount of bass as well as midrange then not the brightest earphones but if you like something which is bass heavy these are definitely it theyre also extremely loud so if you want a lot of audio from your earphones these ones will deliver they do have a wireless touch controls as well and you can use them outdoors as well as during workouts they are IP xx water resistant and sweat resistant as well the good thing about these earphones is that they do offer up about a fivehour usage time and then you can charge up the earphones in the case that comes with it up to three times fully which is brilliant so it is a good combination giving you a total of 20 hours of usage in one single charge of the case and the earphones they fit in the ear quite well theyre really comfortable to wear for long periods of time and you can also call in Siri or Google assistant directly from these earphones as well because they do suppose that feature all in all a really good pair for the price like I said they are available in two colors go check these out if you are looking for something thats really nice and heavy in the bass Department next up are the over base earphones theyre priced at 2000 P is also available in a bunch of colors these are a more subtle design they sit inside the ear we did get them in the red color which is not so subtle they do have bluetooth v dot o but the charging case has 600 milliamp hours as a so once you fully charge the earphones you can use them for five hours and then charge them upwards of five times in the case are giving you a total of 30 hours of usage which is brilliant it does work with Google assistant city or even alexa they do sit inside the ear they are IPX five waterresistant the audio profile is sort of flat not a lot of bass going on with these they do come with additional ear tips as well so you can swap those out get a better fit although they sit inside the ear quite securely so you wont have any issues no matter what the shape or the size of your ear is go check these out if you are looking for a more flat audio profile that you can tweak in your equalizer and get a better audio sample but these do offer up a flat audio profile they are loud enough as well so you do get a lot of volume next up are the air buds now these are one of the best fitting out of the lot priced in add a 1699 these are available only in the black color a really good shape and design and replaceable ear tips as well and they also come with these little winglets that sit inside your ear and make the earphones much more secure they pair up with each other automatically they offer up up to five hours of usage on a full charge and then you can charge the earphones a couple of times giving you upwards of 20 to 22 hours of usage time audio profile is really good really well balanced they sound good the volume is also good the microphone is also nice to pick up the audio so all in all a pretty wellbalanced package and one of the best fitting ones so if you are using this for an active workout or something they will definitely stay in your ear much longer go check these out next up on our list are the xm8 gusto these are 1799 again truly wireless inear style earphones they also have bluetooth 5 dot oh they do come with replaceable ear tips as well now these are extremely compact and do have touch controls on the earphones you can also call in your assistance as well they take about 15 hours to fully charge and each earphone has a 50 ml amp hour battery which gives it about 3 to 4 hours of music as well as talk time so if you are using these 4 calls as well will get about 3 to 4 hours it also comes with a 400 milliamp hour charging case so it does give you additional battery as well inside the case so you can use them upwards of three to four times fully charged from the case as well now one of the coolest things about these earphones is that the case also has an LCD display that constantly gives you the level of battery left inside the case which is really handy for when you are charging or if you are just about to leave you can quickly check the battery life in the case as well which is really useful and helpful if you are planning on using these earphones they pair up automatically with each other and then you can connect them with several devices because they are bluetooth 50 they have really good sound with good amounts of bass as well and then you do have the bass controls on each of these earphones as well so if you can enable a higher base if you want or you can reduce the bass these are extremely lightweight and fit comfortably in the ear and you dont feel them in your ear for longer periods of time so brilliant little earphones go check these out and theyre priced quite well as well now the final product on our list are the porter Onix harmonics and even though the name rhymes are these are pretty interesting earphones available again in a few colors weve got the really nice looking green color over here they are available for rupees 1799 and again Bluetooth five dot oh really compact really nice fit really good design as well buttons on both of these earphones to receive calls if thats something that you want or even pause or play the music they do have smaller batteries so they do have a 40 milliamp hour battery inbuilt and about 320 milliamp hour battery and at the case so you get about 3 hours of usage on the earphones so definitely lesser battery but its a really nice fit now because it uses bluetooth v Low Energy you do get a decent amount of standby time as well theyre not going to give you the maximum battery life so definitely if you want a longer range earphone these will not give you the maximum amount of battery life they are really well made are they are soft materials as well and they offer up a really good sound profile and they work really well with phone calls so the mic and the earpiece are really good on these as well now we tried all of these wireless earphones on gaming with pub G we tried it on the oneplus 70 Pro and all of these devices work perfectly fine with pop G all of them are on Bluetooth 5 dot also connectivity speed seems to be consistent across the board so no problem with any of those and thats it for this video guys if

about a headset Ive already talked about and the reason Im doing the video is because Sony just released the PlayStation Gold wireless headset in white and I thought it deserved its own video so this isnt gonna be a fullon review like the other one was if you are interested in that there will be a link below but I thought we should check out the PlayStation going and white just to see what it looks like just kind of bring up the review again maybe touch on a few points that I didnt touch on before but first off lets go ahead and check to see whats in the box alright so inside the box it does come with the wireless USB dongle because that is how it transmits its audio without this you cannot use it in Wireless mode and to be able to use that they need to be charged which youre able to do with the micro USB charging cable that its included with but battery life really is only about seven or eight hours so that is nothing special here but if you do want to use them wired or your battery runs out youre able to by using this threeandahalf millimeter cable which is also included these do retail for 100 now the black ones also retail for 100 but you can find them on sale usually about 70 to 79 dollars somewhere in that range so the white ones I havent seen on sale there well theyre new and they retail for hundreds so right now youre gonna pay about 20 extra dollars just for the color but speaking of the color this is the white headset and to me the first thing I thought of is almost immediately upon picking up this thing is gonna have fingerprints its gonna get dirty especially like if you wear stuff in your hair or anything like that it wont take long for these to get dirty and they sit and they fit theyre basically the well they are the exact same headset as the black one so as far as features these do have 71 surround sound build quality on these are improved upon the first gen like said in the review these do not fold inward like the original ones did because they had a lot of problems with the hinges and the headband cracking as to wear with these they are very bendable very twistable build quality is so much better in the newer version the ear cups still have that angled look again with the 71 thats pretty important because position of the drivers inside of the ear cups have a lot to do to giving you a better surround sound feel your cups are soft theres not a whole lot of depth to them so if you have smaller ears you may experience touching the inside part and it may irritate your ears now but inside the headband right behind the ear cups is where youll see your left and right all of your controls are on the left ear cup at the bottom you have your micro USB port to charge your headphone jack behind it you have your mute button for the mic you have your volume up and your volume down and then you have your virtual surround sound button now moving along to the front youll see where the indicator light is at and your builtin microphone this does not have a boom mic it has a builtin mic and then you have your off one and two because youre able to put different sound profiles by using the app onto the headset itself and then above that you have the rocker to adjust how much sound of the game you want and how much of the chat that you want basically so you can balance it out and hear yourself at the same time with mic monitoring the headphones adjust by sliding up and down inside the headband and they also have a little bit of wiggle room to kind of position and get comfortable on your ears the way you need them to be now speaking about the microphone that is one of the weak points in the PlayStation Gold headset in my opinion as far as the look goes I really do prefer this white and gray model over the original black I think it just has a classier clean look the fact that the ear cups are grey and the PlayStation logo is grey kind of breaks up the white a little bit right around the edges where all of your controls is its about the only spot that theres a gloss so you dont have to worry about fingerprints but on white its kind of harder to see fingerprints anyway on the outside of the ear cup is more of a textured kind of a matte finish definitely not picking up fingerprints so I think for the most part it will stay clean I just think the headband and the ear cups are probably more than more likely to show like dirt and pick up on stuff easily so if youre gonna get this model this isnt one that I would really recommend like traveling and throwing in a bag because its gonna pick up everything alright so sound sound on these are actually really good theyre fun and exciting to me they have a lot of impact but theyre really clean and the 71 surround sound even though its gimmicky in certain things it can add space in the sound in the fact that Sony has a bunch of different profiles set up inside the headphone companion app that you download on the PlayStation they have a lot of audio profiles that are set up for a bunch of different games that way you dont have to really play around with the profile as much now with music this also sounds really good Im using it Wireless on a PC if you dont want to use it Wireless on the ps4 so it does have some versatility and the fact that you can use it wired with anything that actually still uses a headphone jack I will say if youre not a PlayStation 4 owner I wouldnt recommend these too much but mainly because the mics not back great and it just kind of feels limited or it just feels specialized for the PlayStation but they are Playstation headsets so kind of what you would expect so guys that is my quick video of the brandnew white PlayStation Gold headset like I said its not a fullon review but if you are interested in a full on review there is a link below so thank you guys so much for checking out this video thank you guys so much for checking out all the other videos and as always guys make sure to stay tuned for

video today we have another wireless headphone so these are the JPL tune 600 so some of the other features is that this comes with a detachable aux cable its foldable and you can take phone calls on it and the battery life here with a different noise cancelling on its 12 hours you switched off it can last for 22 hours so ox cable its quite interesting charge cable is very short mainly made of plastic you see shiny plastic on here but it does look quite nice they order JBL they all logo the actual headband is made of the same material as the pads here its kind of like a felt type material Ive seen this on material on some Sony headphones its comfortable but I think these may not last as long as the leather type materials so lets do a quick weight comparison with the beat solo dream so you can see there one seven seven grams these are the beats so you see the beats are 216 117 grams so the JPLs are a fair bit lighter just quick sidebyside comparison with the beats these are the JBLs side switch these on you just simply press and hold the power button here you you can see theres two lights here a blue light meaning the actual headsets on or off and a white light meaning the noise cancellation whether thats on and off so switch the noise cancellation on and off you can just hold down this button that turns noise cancellation off back on again interesting feature of this headphones is that it does not auto switch off so you can use these headphones whilst on a plane or bus or train just for active noise cancellation without even listening to music so we also have the aux socket here and volume up and down here of a mode button in the middle if you hold down the plus or minus buttons they all skip or go to previous track the charge is here the microUSB as you can see you cannot use these mods charging it so the other size of the ear cups have nothing at all no buttons so one of the things I notice is that lights on here pretty bright actually so hows the noise cancellation on these headphones after using it for a trip on a plane and commuting a bit these noise cancellation is actually very good especially for the price I would say this is about two thirds of what the Bose quiet comfort noise cancellation features are so some of the negatives about these headphones is that this felt tight material on the ears they cause your ears to warm up and no doubt will sweat if you wear these for prolonged periods also the materialists headphones are made off its all plastic the headband being matte black cant scuff quite easily and the shiny parts on the ear cups also can get scuffed quite easily  so how did these headphones sound they actually sound very very good especially for the price they are on par with the sony xba4 compared with the beats solo free these do not have as good detail in the mids and highs definitely not as good however the bass on these are really good really really good they actually are better than the beats the beats are punchy bass but these actually have powerful bass at the low end so they really bring out songs so some quality wise they are on par with the sony xba40 so if you have a choice between the two is up to you I would say the Sonys probably would sound slightly better than these in that their mid and high highs will be slightly more detailed than these however these have active noise cancellation which the xB 650s do not have and the design of these are a lot nicer a lot smaller and compact so in my opinion older I would go for these over the Sonys unless you really value the sound now would I buy these over there beats solo freeze well as a bass lover I would say yes because the even though the mids and highs are not as detailed as their beats the bass actually makes up for it like I said it brings out the songs and just gives you more satisfaction when listening to Basie songs its also it has active noise cancellation which the beasts do not have and this is like half the price of the beasts so in my opinion I think these are really worth it and for try I fully recommend these anyway guys I see you in a next video bye Music", "video_title": "JBL Tune 600 BT ANC Wireless Headphones

"video_id": "bpEqkyDa3vE", "Closed Captions": " hey everybody Im here today to do a review of these Motorola Verve buds 500 these are wireless earbuds and theyre absolutely awesome and in this video review Ill be going over the features and functions with you as you can see they actually have this convenient and awesome carrying case and charging case so you can basically charge the charging case and then store the earbuds in the charging case and allow them to charge up while on the go and it also allows you to keep them together nice and easily Im gonna actually just remove them from the charging case and theyre very very easy and convenient to remove and place in there and Ill show you the actual earbuds as you can see right here the first thing that I want to go over is the design of the earbuds theyre absolutely awesome I mean with regards to how easy they are to use they are so easy to setup and incredibly easy to use they have this convenient multifunction button down here at the bottom that can be used for different things so right now Im just going to shut this one off by holding it down and you can see theres just basically one button on each of the earbuds and its used for a wide variety of purposes now theyre lightweight and they are so sleek and gorgeous if you take a look at them like theyre just they have this all black design this pair right here the Motorola logo on the side one multifunction button at the bottom and these earbuds right here and then these little charging parts right over here in addition to the earbuds themselves you also receive a variety of sizes for the fittings so that means that you can actually use these to fit your ear properly so right now I have the medium ones inside of there and they work well for me but you know they have extra small small medium large and extra large you can pretty much get whichever one fits your ear the best and it also has this nice charging cable and I like this charging cable because its relatively short so youre not gonna have a crazy amount of cable left over and you also dont need to charge them that often because they have a great battery life and also you have the charging case so thats why in my opinion the short cable is best for these specific earbuds now in addition to looking amazing feeling amazing and being really easy to set up and use theyre also great for everything basically for listening to music making calls or taking calls I mean if you want a pair of wireless earbuds that will allow you to be very versatile then these are the ones for you and their cost is incredible you get an amazing value for the price that youre paying now heres one of the best features of these earbuds in my opinion you can use either of the earbuds as a mono Bluetooth headset so that means that if you want to preserve the battery life you can use this earbud until the battery dies as a mono bluetooth headset then you can use this ear button as a mono bluetooth headset that means you can basically double the length of time that you can use these for if youre using them as a as a mono Bluetooth headset so only one in each ear now like I said the size is absolutely perfect because theyre not too small but theyre also not too large Ive seen wireless earbuds that are really small and theyre great because they easily fit in your ears and theyre super lightweight but they can be easily lost these ones are the perfect size theyre not too small so you can always keep track of them but theyre not too big so theyre not gonna weigh you down or really part rude out of your ear theyre just in my opinion the absolute perfect size now when I was wearing them they were unbelievably comfortable the quality of sound that they produced for both listening to music and for making calls and taking calls was incredible it was a great volume just enough and like I said you feel if I wanted to sort of listen to music loudly and sort of rock out and jam out they worked well for that if I wanted to make a call or take a call with a relatively low volume they worked well for that now just before I finish off I want to show you this is the case right here watch how easily they can be placed in the case sort of feels magnetized like I placed them down and it sort of feels like a magnetic little powers bringing them in place just like that so theyre easily placed in there you can close up the case when you open it up you see the battery life of the charging case see whats going on with the headphones I mean theyre really really really can and really easytouse just like that very simple very simple design and thats basically it in this video I just wanted to do a review of these Motorola Verve earbuds 500 if you liked this video be sure to give it a thumbs up let me know what you think down below as a comment and of course be sure to subscribe for more great videos just like this one and thats all I have for you today thanks for

"Closed Captions": " everything is going Wireless nowadays and so other headphones so in this video I will try to compare the two major competitors inside the two thousand rupee price bracket and that would be the booth over 600 on the blue dial T 2 plus so lets get straight into it is you two before starting with the review many of you guys asked meaning to submit an entry for the take create round have so made the entry on if you guys want to see you can go up to my Instagram account and watch it there because there isnt allow it to make public on YouTube so thats what Ive been really disappointed by the headphone on your phone to use done by Q tubers do this because they dont portray an accurate description of how the headphone or your phone actually is and that could be because they only tested with like a simple set of music or they are biased towards some kind of music so just for an example I bought these Audio Technica CLR 100 by watching it reviews on youtube so if youre watching this video on the Audio Technica CLR 100 you will not be able to differentiate between this and this because these headphones have almost no bass in them and not many people who review these headphones will tell you about that so well jump on with audio quality straight away when it comes to volume the brooder t2 plus is like really really loud I have never used any headphones louder than the blue diode t21 but they can also tend to distort a bit on the higher volume but for the most part the volume is quite good the volume on the board rockers is not as loud as the blue dial 1 but it is also decently loud one thing to note in common between these two when you connect any of these using an aux cable to your mobile or your computer the volume and audio quality will decrease a bit and I think thats common with most wireless headphones so I will try to compare the mid highs and lows of these two headphones the highs are not that clear on the blue dye ot twos and they kind of mix with the midtones a lot on the boot rockers the highs are not very overpowering but they are not under powering at the same time they are very natural sounding the mids are good on both these but I feel that on the Blue Devil ones they kind of mix the delusion eyes on the boat rockers the mates are very natural just like the highs and lows and they dont tend to mix with each other so if youre using your headphones to listen to instrumental music or jazz you have to go for the boat rockers because I have to say instrumental music doesnt sound good at all on the Blue Devil but when you talk about lose or be saving music the Blue Devil ones have absolutely killer loud bass that will definitely vibrate your ears the bass is loud and overpowering but its not segregated and can feel a bit muddy on the board rock is one also the bass is very good but not as overpowering has on the blue that ones so if youre going for rap music or bass heavy music is consulting only the audio the blue dial one should be the first choice however if you listen to all kinds of music and want to natural highs I met audio or you are doing some kind of sound production work then you should definitely go for the board rockers so if I want to sum it up the blue dial ones have a very base heavy punchy feel to it and on the other hand you have a very soothing and natural experience from the board Roxas so I have to give props for both of the companies for being very realistic with the battery because it says v8 hours on the cover on the boot up is one and it actually has eight hours while using it it generally lasts me around three to four days on an average use on the other hand the blue dial ones have an insane battery life it walks up to 40 hours on a full charge you can easily go two weeks without charging these so Before we jump on to the build quality uncomfort of these headphones you can click on the subscribe button because I keep making content like this if you guys have ever used headphones you will know that the build quality and comfort of EDD phones is very important and if you cant wear headphones for more than half an hour the headphones are quite useless the build quality on the blue die ones feels very cheap its all plastic on the material used is also not a very good quality when you touch or try to twist the headband Aldus cop you can feel that it is very cheap quality plastic and it has some kind of a cardboard or very cheap quality plastic material covering it up also it has big turbine written on the headband and you seriously have a lot of grinding on these headphones so when you get to the ways in spite of being plastic they are a bit heavy but theyre not too heavy and I would any day prefer 40 hours of battery life over a little bit of it however the material used on the ear cups and the one on the headband is synthetic and its not very comfortable and on the website it says that the headphones are over the year and most people feel that these are on your headphones but Im having me do sizes on the kind of fit in between and thats the worst fit that you can have the headphones dont cover your folio and the kind of set at the edge of your ears that is very uncomfortable also your ears start touching the material inside the form that is also synthetic and is we using at all Ill be quite honest all you what it is quite good but I cant wear these headphones along the buttons however are quite good and you can easily make out between the volume buttons on the buttons to change no zip you also get some nifty features with this iPhone like you can connect another headphone to the 35 mm jack when these headphones are connected by a brutal when it comes to comfort the boot rockers are like with different spectrum as compared to the brooder ones because they are very comfortable and the quality of material used is also quite good these have light source large styles on the ear build the material used on the cushions on the hip and a synthetic but its quite comfortable these are also very tight so sometimes you wont even see that theyre on air use the quality of materials used on the both rockers Ill be a better this diffuse off to use but because of the metal on the good quality plastic we also feed studying the harnesses the buttons are also quite intuitive on URM on the right side the both rope is one seat decently premium for the price I dont know how many of you guys might be using the mic on these one but have to say that the mic on the blue that I want is good but is not as good as the one on the board rockers the connectivity on both of these is quite good and we have about 7 meters to 8 meters of range so the best buy links will be in the description box below and let me know

noise cancelling headphones and I want to show you here exactly how these headphones work how to operate them and these headphones have a lot of features so I dont to spend too much time so lets get going here with the first feature here I start out here with the left ya piece we have here on the bottom we have two micro USB charging port and these headphones come with these micro USB charging cable and in order to charge these headphones you just plug this in here and then as soon as youve done this you will see here this tiny red LED is going to light up that means its charging and in case this LED turns off that means that the battery is fully charged and then you can unplug the cable again and in case when youre using this here and its the red light here is blinking that means that the battery is low and you should plug this in soon okay so in case you need some more information then I have this video here in the upper right corner you may want to try that out check that

my iPhone here in this case and in case you need assistance with how to connect this to your smartphone then I recommend this other video here in the upper right corner this shows you exactly how to do that in detail so now lets keep going so we had the onoff button and then we have here the plus button this is two raise the volume let me show you this by just playing some music here okay so let me demonstrate so we just push the plus button on this case the volume is already at the top its the loudest already so let me use the minus button first to lower the volume and then raise the volume with the plus button now if we press and hold this button here for two seconds the plus button that is then its going to go to the next audio track and if we press and hold the minus button for two seconds were going to go to the previous track so let me show you this really quick see now we just changed the track here and now here in the middle rear of another button this is here the play and pause button see push this once and it pauses you push it again and it plays again now in case you get a phone call then you can make a phone call you can take pick up this phone call with these headphones and in case when its ringing and you push this play pause button once youre going to pick up the call and if you push or press this for two seconds then youre going to reject the call and

"Closed Captions": " hello this is a demonstration of the RS 195 and its features and settings the RS 195 offers unique features unprecedented from Sennheiser because for the first time in a wireless headphone the sub can be individually tailored to the listeners needs in this video we will explain the technology at work here for this well assume the system is connected to a TV or other source if you cannot see that an LED is lit up no hearing Boost has been activated and the RS 195 is basically just a regular wireless headphone lets start setting it up first the TV needs to be turned on and set to a program where theres dialogue or just human speech in it this will help you best hear the improvements in speech intelligibility when switching through the profiles so make sure the TV is running and set to a suitable program also make sure the headphones volume is up try the buttons to see where the level is set first the balance we recommend for this to be set first if the listener prefers one side louder than the other this should be step 1 lets assume the balance is set now lets activate a hearing profile for this hold one of the mode buttons for two seconds so the LED above the ear symbol lights up should more than one LED light up press mode again until only the LED in the middle is lit this means the pure hearing profile is activated now the listener can pick his ideal setting on the rotary switch there are a two G settings available every letter features a different sound profile we recommend trying all of them once this is something the user should try out individually there is no right or wrong setting here the one that sounds best to the listener is the right one the sound profiles have been developed by Sennheiser in partnership with the Fraunhofer IDM tea Institute to achieve optimal hearing loss compensation and there is more happening than just a tweaking of frequencies in addition volume limits are being applied to the audio output coming from the TV making sure a sudden jump and loudness like for example in a movie scene does not result in unpleasant bursts of increased volume apart from limiting the maximum loudness level the technology ensures that sounds at low levels will also remain audible at all times this goes for all the sound profiles from A to G in technical terms this is called a dynamic range and its carefully defined behind every sound profile lets assume a pleasant hearing profile is found there are two additional operation modes that the user can add now there is speech Boost on the left and music mode on the right speech boost is for television use and music mode is for music listening of course lets start with speech boost for watching television this function can be activated to further increase speech intelligibility press mode you can always use the mode button at the headphones as well which ever is more convenient and the left LED lights up the technology at work now can differentiate between human speech and background noise how could the audible result be described for example when there is a voice in a noisy environment like a TV reporter speaking into his microphone while standing on the side of a busy road or in a large crowd where theres lots of noise around him activating this function will significantly reduce that background noise and everything else that is not speech so understanding dialogue or human speech in general becomes much easier and more relaxed to follow if the user finds it difficult or somewhat tiring to follow speech on TV when its in a noisy environment that is what this mode is specifically designed to take care of with the activation of speech boost weve combined a hearing profile D for example and further added increased speech intelligibility on to that so much for speech boost now lets say youd want to listen to music with the RS 195 for this this Beach boost would alter the sound of the music quite considerably so press mode once to switch to music mode weve now combined the music mode with the sed hearing profile whats behind the music mode in music mode the headphone allows more overall volume and high frequencies as well as slightly boosting the bass the technology will now allow for a wider dynamic range of sound reproduction within the headphone which is an important factor for music listening also we would highly recommend trying a different setting from time to time to see if your needs or preferences have changed this goes for both of the listening modes lastly you can connect the system to two sources simultaneously however only one can be heard at a time so for connecting the RS 195 to a TV and for music listening we recommend using the optical port for connecting it to the TV as thats the most common interface on TV sets and the analog input as the connection to a receiver PC or mobile device etc to switch between sources use the input selection switch at the back of the transmitter

everybody Im Chris look now before we start the review I just want to say Bose Soundlink aroundear wireless headphone  its kind of a mouthful to say so thats the only time we want to say it this review until the very end all right cool lets start the review open up the box and the first thing youll see is the included soft shell carrying case zip it open and inside youll find the headphones as well as a pouch containing the backup audio cable and the USB cable underneath youll find the manual and warranty information these come in two color varieties white with tan highlights and black with blue highlights the white variation may be more in line with the classic Bose look but if you ask us the black is the sharper looking of the two the look in general feel should be instantly recognizable if you try to pair Bose headphones in the past few years as weve seen with the companies designs and Bluetooth speakers Oh seems to take a if it aint broke dont fix it root when it comes to updating its designs as a result these happen to look very much like the qc25 s only  the cable bow says these are engineered with impact resistant materials its tough to say how tough they actually are without actively trying to break them but thats nice to know while the headphones will flatten out theyre not collapsible so if youre throwing them in a backpack make sure to tuck them inside the included case when it comes to actually wearing the headphones theyre light and comfortable just like the sound true and qc25 before them they stay comfortable  but they do get a little warm after a while Bose has gone a long way towards making these headphones user friendly and the voice prompt that provides battery life and pairing status on turning the headphones on is a great example of that pairing and repairing the headphones is an easy process even compared to how simple many headphones make it these days these headphones can be paired to two devices at the same time allowing you to switch between them with ease Moses example is watching a video on an iPad while also connected to an iPhone if a call comes in it can switch pausing the video in the process take the call and resume video playback when the call ends there is a major focus on making and taking calls here phone support HD voice and feature adaptive audio adjustment to help keep call quality good even when youre in noisy or windy environments neither of these environments were available while we were testing the call quality was indeed much nicer than some other headphones weve seen looking at the controls its the standard three buttons the plus and minus buttons only control volume here everything else is taken care of by tapping the multifunction button tapping once will pause and resume playback or answer and end calls tapping twice will skip forward while tapping three times skips backward both claims an impressive 15 hours of playback time and during our testing we found this to be right on the mark charge time is stated as 3 hours though this will depend on the charger you use since none is included just the USB cable oh says that a quick charge time of 15 minutes will provide up to 2 hours of battery life which is handy if you do find yourself running out of battery life just make sure to keep the included audio cable with you unlike a lot of bluetooth headphones these will work in passive mode meaning plugged in of course the volume will be a little lower and the headphones wont sound exactly the same thats why Bose refers to this as a backup audio cable the lows are solid enough but if you live and die for bass these probably arent going to do it for you instead these go for a happy medium the bass is certainly more present than many consumer focused headphones but it doesnt go over the top that said the bass on some song sounded like it was coming from a subwoofer somewhere in the room behind me the EQ curve here is far from flat but unlike many headphones released in the last few years the mids arent kicked down into the ditch vocals are never buried by keys or guitars which isnt an easy feat for some headphones the highs never speak up enough to become overly harsh and there definitely is some rolloff present from the active EQ but they dont sound artificially toned down the sound of the pick hitting acoustic guitar strings would preserve nicely without ever becoming overbearing listening to these headphones its clear that the DAC is playing with the sound much more than on other Bluetooth headphones fortunately Bose has been doing this long enough that the company has learned a thing or two and while I generally prefer a more handsoff approach when it comes to how the source audio is handled I thought listening to these headphones to be pretty enjoyable youre not going to find any active noise cancellation here youll need to look into the 400 QC s to get that from Bose but the passive isolation is quite effective with music playing even at lower volumes youre going to struggle to hear anything going on around you the same cant be said for others hearing what youre listening to however these do leak a decent amount of sound just like Beats Im sure there are plenty of people who made their mind up as soon as they saw the Poes name if thats what you want to do thats fine but you may be missing out someone who normally prefers more accurate sound I still really enjoyed my time with these theyre not for everyone but theyre very good at what they do were giving the Bose Soundlink aroundear wireless

headset from qcy and this model is called us  I already did videos of the qs1 and t1 pro so make sure you go see them if you didnt already do so there are links in the video description and on top of the screen on the back of the box its written that the air phones can play music for up to 4 hours per charge and standby its 120 hours the case has an extra capacity of 800 milliamp hours lets open the box and see what we got Music ok here we have the case its matte black color with the qcy logo on the top it actually looks quite nice Music you also have some accessories in here theres extra earbuds in different sizes standard soft pots made of rubber regarding charging I wished I would start using USB typec but its only got a micro USB 2 standard USB so we still have to keep an extra cable for charging in the case the case design is clean and nice on the front we have a LED light that will blink while is charging on the back we have the micro USB connector and under we have some specs and information to lay this magnetic and inside we have the 2 earphones they look exactly the same as the ones that we get with EQ as one package I dont know if you can see it but the lid is actually a bit transparent very very little but enough to see the LED lights on the air phones while they are charging so you dont need to open the lid to see if the charge has completed or not Music their phones are very compact ever made of plastics on the bottom there is a little hole where the microphone is the sound quality is beautiful calls and Ive had no issues with it heres the charging connector and a little letter indicating which side it is almost the whole front is covered by the button and a small LED light the right one is of course the same and theres a microphone on both of them removing the rubber buds is very easy just pull them straight off and other we can see the speaker grille the rubber bands also isolates the sound very well and active noise reduction isnt really needed in my opinion to put the bird spat on just push it the air phones are as usual held in where magnetic drop them in and close to it as mentioned before the red charging lights on the air phones are visible through the lid but its a bit difficult to catch with the camera so Ill have a picture on the side to charge the case disconnect the cable to any five volt power supply I usually use a power bank phone charger or my laptop while charging the air phones the lights will be red and when they are fully charged they will turn white for a little while before turning off two pair this pull them out and as you can see here in left their phone will connect to the right one now we need to connect the right one to the phone just turn on Bluetooth and search for ucy us to our heart for right click it and we go air phones will confirm the connection we both sound and by turning off the lead on the phone we can also see the remaining battery capacity which is very nice now lets disconnect it and see how fast it will reconnect its quite fast now lets jump over to the music controls we can click once to play and pause the song it doesnt matter if you do it on the left or right there phone click twice on the right one to go to the next song click twice on the left one to go to start of a song or again to go to the previous self if you hold the button to assistant or see if you will start a job do you like Star Wars or Star Trek this type of earphones are very comfortable to wear as there are basically no parts touching your ears except the rubber buds themself this push them in and they will sit there without falling out they are also quite small so not very noticeable the sound quality is good enriched and they got a good amount of bass surprisingly good for such small earphones the dont sound muffled and got a good overall spread of the sound even without tuning with the equalizer the battery usually lasts about three hours per charge with loud music but a total capacity including the 800 milliamp case should be up to max 32 hours when it comes to delay I must say it is low but it is noticeable it hasnt bothered me while watching videos but it might be annoying if you play games that require precise timing of the sound ipx4 water resistance is also in place which means its not waterproof but it can take some small splashing overall this is a very nice product for such a low price before the purchase is there phones just link to be descriptions below hope you liked the video and remember to subscribe comment and like if you have any questions

up a set of headphones and I felt like I was in the doctors office its kind of like when youre taking a hearing test you hear all these computerized sounds but it just felt crazy it felt very futuristic I was smiling the whole time now with that being said they do have two touch buttons I to the buttons on each side those are touch capacitive buttons these headphones automatically turn off

a major major major go my mind is blown now let me give you a reference on what they sound like anybody that has the skull crusher candy wireless headphones with that fake reproduce extra head pounding bass imagine that kind of base but sounded a little bit more clean now heres the thing inear headphones they give you a more of a real sound because the head the headphones are going right into your eardrums so in ear headphones they always sound a little bit richer and a little bit cleaner then over there in my opinion so imagine Im at this little if you want to see how these sound just take your favorite inear headphones put them in your ears and they take another set of headphones and put them on top of them so you got the headphones in your ears and there are big cups engulfing your ears basically like an airtight seal yeah very rarely am I am I at a loss for words the sound on these headphones Ill just answer a simple question Audis worked for hundred bucks and the answer is yes without a doubt now Im gonna keep a real job I was kind of hoping Im getting a phone call ignore that I was kind of hoping that these wasnt that good because Id be having so many requests to try these out at Florida bucks I was like now I really wasnt feeling them like that you know whenever people overhyped stuff I tend to not really buy into the hype but this is one time whoever was hyping these up and whoever asked me to review these thank you hey thank you these headphones are in sane now they all wireless yo I got a pause Im opposing video real quick i know im hype im a poison video real quick im gonna try out a couple of different songs i got a play this is america that song got mad bass im gonna try to a couple of different songs a couple of different genres of music and I come back to yall in a second talk amongst yourselves all right John so we back in and I had to calm down pick my brain up off the floor put it back in my head let me tell you something on a scale of one to ten these are a major major major major go I am blown away now if you dont trust me or nothing else trust me your knees these are gonna blow your mind right now its over for my sons its over for my sin Isis its over for my beats Ill still keep the Skullcandy questions for the gym but these are definitely gonna be my new official travel headphones now theres no noise cancellation but youre not gonna need that the way these fit you got the in here and over it forms a tight seal youre not gonna hear nothing else around you and the sound quality is literally incredible now I dont know what kind of Star Wars technology they got going on here but whatever it is it works now the only downside I can see to these so far is it didnt come with a cable so now when you get on the airplane you dont have a cable now I just Google it real quick you could go to the website you could buy the USB typec you could buy lightning adapter it doesnt come with the cables but it is what it is are these headphones worth 400 and the answer is hell yeah without a doubt even if I were to pay 500 for these I would theyll be completely happy yeah I cant see me behind the camera but I played a bunch of different songs I played this is America I played some disco yeah I know the heartbeats I played the barbeque music this outstanding trust me when I tell you each song that you play it sounds different but if you play a song that has a lot of bass if you like a lot of bass go to the app and put that on front stage trust me when I turn I hate sounding like a

going to do a sidebyside comparison on the Bose sound for free wireless the left pair here is a fake pair and the right is a real pair that I purchased through authorized both dealer and this is para purchase on ebay make a mistake that I fell for the 100 rating and you know good reputation seller anyway so lets start off with the difference this year the little sliding box here the fake pair youre not gonna notice the difference in unless you have these the real pair in hand but the real pair is a lot more crisp sturdy box white background this here is not this is grayish a total copy you can tell and you can start here with the boxes here also with the white with the serial number the fake pair is a little bit smeared thicker lettering the real pair is crisp everything also when you set these up to for your warranty youre all gonna want to do that when you buy these have you invested that much money of course you want to have your warranty set in so if you go into the both app I mean not the Bozak the DuBose website and you register them for your warranty its gonna take it regardless if theyre real or fake theyre just it looks like theyre just recycling the numbers so thats not an indicator whether theyre real or fake ok so be careful with that let me open these up lets get going with this this is fake pair again real pair so the real pairs in the bottom alright the picture here itself this is a copy again youre not gonna notice difference unless youre comparing it this is more crisp to copy as far as this the booklets arent almost identical but the real pairs a lot more crisp is a lot more wrinkled than you but not that replacement tips where the real pair comes with the serial numbers sealed completely and label large and small okay the fake pair comes in a ziploc bag the charger the cable for the fake pair is just regular one just not much of a difference Ive done real pair has its own tag and zero and serial number also as far as the headphones go the fake pair its a little bluish fingerprints are there and greasy its just really easy to get dirty the the real pairs a lot sturdier and thick when you open these up this was a big indicator for me but look at this it just fell apart Im probably not gonna have that happen all the time okay so mine was a pretty easy giveaway you see how you got to move around for it to charge see its not really doing it unless you move it with the real Paris is nice and sturdy open them up another comparison really quick as far as the headphones go okay the orange ones are the fake real just that the weight itself just right off the bat you can tell this is more sturdy a little bit heavier these are not these are a lot lighter the plastic here in the back for the fake pair blueish scratched just cheap this is nice and shiny the charging tip here the gold for the fake pair its a little cheaper and this is lots crisp and shinier the feel as far as a typical the fake pair just feels a little flimsy these feel really sturdy if youre an amateur and dont really know much about the sound and dont have an experience once you put these on than you hear them its actually really good theyre not bad okay but its not until you try the real ones that you notice a difference the base the clarity everything is just this is really good on the on the real ones these are well once you compare them or not the fit on both its pretty good actually you know if youre like I said youre an amateur youre probably not gonna notice a difference but yeah theyre getting really good with the with the fake snow but also if you want to save yourself some time and just you know go through all this and start comparing getting down to the details download the both connect app and as soon as you download that and open the app and you open these up the both connect app is gonna read them right away and ask you to you know set them up and download the new software the firmware or whatever these will not connect to the app at all whatsoever so even if you go online and they ask you to troubleshoot because youre 100 convinced that are real and they asked you to delete the app and download it again and whatever and its not gonna work no its not its supposed to pick it up right away so yeah thats the biggest indicator there but as far as quality goes just be careful because its not much of a difference so anyways

pair of true wireless headphones but this next one actually comes very close hey guys its John Vee here with phone Reena and this is a review of the Sony WF 1000x Im not really a fan of that name but it is what it is so these are Sonys latest true wireless headphones and whats unique about them is that they have some premium elements that youre not gonna find with other headphones like noise cancellation so let me start off with their design its a little bit under peculiar side just because they strike a balance between casual and sport but they never seemed to satisfy either now for me it kind of looks tacky because it has this faux metal polished finish which is kind of surprising because Sony is really known for its high premium designs every like how they fit in the ear they have a snug fit thats thanks in part to the swing ear hooks that they offer but its kind of strange that it doesnt have a water or sweat resistant construction which is something we see in many headphones in its class given that this is Sony were talking about its kind of shocking just because I feel they kind of dropped the ball when it comes to the battery charging case it looks clunky and it doesnt really offer that much in terms of functionality yes its a case Ill protect it and yes itll charge them as well but the overall package is kind of lacking in comparison to what weve seen out there for example youre only going to get two additional charges out of the case and its functionality is very limited youre not gonna find any charging capabilities with this one to charge other devices nor are you going to find any sort of magnetic connections for the earbuds and what makes the Sony WF 1000x a little bit more unique than some of the other true wireless headphones weve checked out is that youre going to use the Sony headphone connect app for Android or iOS whats really neat about is that it offers predefined equalizer settings to choose from which offers greater audio fidelity in general on top that will provide relevant information like the battery life the volume controls the sound quality mode and adjustments for its adaptive sound controls its basically a smart sensing technology the headphones will actually listen in to your surroundings and lauda matically true the correct adaptive sound controls for you I take for example walking mode which will boost the ambient noise around you while youre wearing the earbuds and also while listening to music most of the playback controls are done through the app there are these tiny fiscal buttons on each earbud the left one will automatically cycle through the different adaptive sound controls while the right one will just do a pause play function these earbuds leverage Bluetooth 41 technology and it does have pretty good range and my testing got roughly around 25 feet a little bit short of its rating of 35 feet but still not bad but better yet is that I didnt have too many occasions where it dropped the connection Ill tell you now though the biggest dealbreaker for me is that it has some latency issues when it comes to watching video theres a delay so obviously what theyre watching what theyre hearing are never in sync and obviously this is a distraction but when it comes to sound quality I really cant complain because yes you do have those equalizer settings to choose from and even without using one of them the overall quality has a very neutral balance and it doesnt lean too heavily on one particular audio range so the lows mids and highs are well represented I only minor complaint about the sound quality is that it struggles with the lows a little bit you want to select the bass boost option and finally I have to admit this probably has one of the best noise cancellation features around it does a phenomenal job in neutralizing background noise battery life for me is kind of average here I managed to get roughly two and half hours from a single charge but thats gonna largely depend on whether or not you enable noise cancellation right now you could probably pick up the Sony WF 1000x for about 180 and that places it in the premium segment in the market for the price youre getting a ton of features you have noise cancellation have those equalizer settings to choose from a pretty good audio quality in general and you have those ambient sound modes to choose from on the downside though it lacks a waterresistant construction youre going to find those latency issues with video and the battery charging case is kind of clunky seriously though this came very close to being the perfect pair of true wireless headphones but it falls just a little bit short so if you guys want to learn more about the sony WF 1000x you could check out our website phone Reno

audiotechnica has just revamped their classic headphones 280x m50x headphones now with bluetooth capabilities Im super juiced to give you guys this review now this is what weve all been waiting for so now that they are here how did the new m50x bluetooth turn out has audio technica made history again with these headphones find out today so lets start off with the comfort and design they keep that same classic design of the black with the silver trimmings it looks just as gorgeous as the day I first set my eyes on them about five years ago the m50x Bluetooth keep that same amazing build quality as the originals you can really beat these things up and not skip a beat get it on the left ear cup you have a volume rocker and playpause button where you can skip tracks as well theres also a power button and a pairing slider near the front of the cub and this presented a problem for me its very hard and confusing to navigate the control system on these headphones sometimes especially since the buttons are on the flat side and not clearly mark where you can fill them with your fingers and things like that also on the left ear cup you have a 35 millimeter jack the 35 millimeter chord has a controller and a mic which is a nice touch and theres also an included USB charger the headband is comfortable and the leather cups still clamp to your head giving you that true close back experience some people might not like that added pressure but this actually keeps you from needing noise cancellation because nothing gets past these ear cups in conclusion amazing build quality and comfort if you like closed back headphones for the design of the new Bluetooth Patrols I wish they were a little bit better but they arent bad but I mean lets be honest theyre not necessarily great then 50 Xs are known to be some of the most balanced headphones for audio engineers and music enthusiasts they feature a 45 millimeter aperture driver which is incredibly detailed for the price of 200 guys I kid you not these are the sounding Bluetooth headphones that Ive tried this year in my opinion and they are only 200 that is just an incredible deal these are closed back so you wont get that open back spaciousness but in turn you gain that close back bass and power all instruments and vocals sound that much stronger coming from a great set of closed back headphones from Frank Ocean to Calvin Harris to Pink Floyd these reproduced music so well acoustic songs also sound buttery smooth I feel like Im riding on a musical sheet of the musicians playing their instruments simply amazing whats better is that you can actually plug these into a DAC app as well and get like an audiophile type system going on at home if you want audio technica really nailed it with these headphones I must say Im thoroughly impressed but I think that you guys will be too once your ears get a hold of these bad boys the battery life is rated at 40 hours holy crap not only that but you get amazing sound on top of it so you get to enjoy that amazing sound of the m50 exes for 40 freakin hours I wasnt expecting that I always think it may be like 15 to 20 kind of like vmoda you know they kind of stress having really good sound quality and not much on the like bluetooth and battery side so its a really nice that theyve coupled this with an amazing package theyre really trying to give you a legendary headphone with these set of cans the call quality is good enough for most applications I wouldnt say its the best but I would say its definitely on part with slepping like Sony but not as good as Bose the connection is rocksolid in crowded areas these also feature aptX for you Android users out there and AC for iPhone users and its rockin bluetooth 50 I tell you guys Audio Technica pack these things full with the best technology they really want to make history with these headphones and quite frankly they did these make vmoda sound like a childrens toy in my opinion the m50x BTS are a statement headphone and theyve left a great impression on me guys so if you guys are thinking about picking these up let me know down below thank you guys for watching Ill have a link in the description so you can buy these because these are amazing for 200 bucks you will be blown away let me tell you no matter what you listen to no matter what you like these will do a great job so thank

noisecancelling headphones for under 200 bucks lets check them out Music Dave Taylor here anam hang on a second okay Dave Taylor here and Im checking out these these are the sign Heiser HD 4 series more specifically HD 45 0b TNC wireless Bluetooth active noisecancelling headphones its a lot of words there and the good news is those words are all worth it because these are really nice headphones now let me start with the most fun part which is they fold up not only do they fold up but they have a little convenient little carrying bag and it makes it really easy for you to tow them around now turns out they actually not only sound really good which is exactly what youd expect from Sennheiser but the active noise cancellation is good enough that I put music on on my stereo and then put music on the headphones and then turned on the active noise cancellation which they call noise guard and you know what I couldnt hear the stereo I could only hear these now part of this is because its a closed back design so when you put these on your ears you get a pretty darn good seal so theres not much ambient noise youre getting anyway but once you figure out how to turn on active noise guard which is actually probably one of the biggest problems that these headphones have but well get back to the controls in a second but once you figure out how to turn those on then works really well now on the edge of the right cup you have power you have this sort of weird multifunction button that if you push its pause play but you can move it up or down to get to previous or next track you can also use it to answer a phone call or hang up on someone because it does have builtin microphones so it works really well for phone calls as long as you can handle having a phone call while you cant hear any ambient noise I dont particularly like that myself so I dont use these for phone calls but they do sound nice now lets see the third control is volume up and down and then theres a play for actually plugging in a wire included which is nice because sometimes you dont want to use them in Bluetooth mode and you can actually use it wired at which point if you power them on then you automatically get the active noise cancellation in Bluetooth mode its a little more complicated well come back to that and then finally the last of the plugs is micro USB comes with a micro USB cable and thats for charging but heres a crazy thing that you charge these fully and they will give you up to 25 hours of listening thats a really long time its a really long battery for something thats really negligibly light its really youre not gonna feel this at all its very comfortable headphones now lets see its Bluetooth 40 and it also includes NFC and support for aptX which is nice unless you have an iPhone like I do and for reasons I cant explain Apple includes aptX on its MacBooks but it doesnt include them on the iPhone so it says use AAC sign Heiser doesnt have AC on this so you just get regular bluetooth which still sounds really really good now 18 ohms 18 to 22000 Hertz frequency response less than 05 total harmonic distortion just in case you like those numbers and theyre comfortable and flexible and obviously you can pull them out and they even have some wear on them there I guess it doesnt really yeah it does list left and right always good but all the controls are on the right cup so you know that you do this and now you have all the controls on your finger so lets talk about the controls for a minute as it turns out that it does take a little bit of practice a little bit of messing around to try to get the hang of how the controls work and the noise guard is a little confusing because sine Heiser says that have three different profiles for noise guard but theres no indication that theres any way to choose between the profiles for different noise environments not a big deal the challenge is actually figuring out how to turn it on and turns out that you turn on your headphones you pair them with a device like my iPhone then you hold the volume up and down simultaneously for three seconds and that turns on the active noise cancellation if you use it in a wired mode its just automatic you turn this thing on boom you got noise cancellation I really wish they would have done something a little simpler or just automatically have it turn on every time you turn on the headphones that would be nice too this might be something they could do I dont know maybe with a firmware update probably not gonna happen but for this generation there is a tiny learning curve you are gonna have to figure out a little bit the you know track updown button getting noise canceling turned on but once you get over that little hump of learning then I gotta say its a really nice headphones they have a really nice rich full sound theres no penalty that I can hear when you turn on noise canceling some people say that noise cancelling actually reduces the audio fidelity of the music youre listening to totally dont find that and frankly because of their clothes design and theyre soft cups that mold around your ear even if you dont put on the active noise cancellation that these do a really nice job of cutting out the majority of the outside ambient noise unfortunately I havent tried these on an airplane I would like to but I dont think that theyre gonna help pay for my plane ticket so until I have that opportunity I will just say I have used them in noisy environments and theyve worked really well nice soundstage warm response and well the music sounds really good its not tinny or bright on the high end theres good bass without it being muddy everything youd expect from sign Heiser I mean these guys absolutely know how to make really good headphones and they have really good audio so its really the noise cancelling and the fact that these are so easily portable that make these more perhaps notable of course the other thing that makes them really notable is the price now youre looking at these and youre thinking these look pretty comparable to those fancy sony and bose act active noisecancelling headphones that you see people wearing in first class on that airplane but these are not at that level of price which fantastic but before we get there go do me a favor click that subscribe button subscribe to my channel super appreciate it and what the heck thumbs up if you like what Im doing now the price these sign Heiser HD 45 OBT NC wireless bluetooth headphones with active noise cancellation will put will cost you a hundred and seventy 999 at amazoncom and I actually can hear my music it is pretty darn loud probably shouldnt do that while were on the video but you know higherend units might have tap and drag features on the earpieces and such but these are actually just a nice compromise of being affordable and having a lot of really good features and nice sound and a good active noise canceling system and the fact that theyre so portable huge win so this is Dave Taylor I am gonna get back to my music so Ill catch you in my next video Music", "video_title": "Sennheiser HD 450 BTNC Active Noise

"video_id": "ifcXCdSgPL8", "Closed Captions": " everybody welcome back to tech Odyssey so today Im here with a review of anchors a sound core Liberty neo wireless earphones now Ive recently reviewed the Liberty airs and they were very good but I actually like these a little bit better so as you can see on the front there ultracompact theyve got a nice clamshell style charging case its very light convenient easy to carry around and really Im a big fan of these especially for the low price of 5999 kind of hard to beat that but they are completely wireless theres no wires anywhere its not like the ones where they have the wire that connects the two together you dont have to worry about anything and stuff all you have to do is just pop them in your ears and go and theyre very easy to pair theyre very easy to charge they recharge and an hour and a half so completely charged in an hour and a half and you get three and a half hours of playtime of course that does vary based off of your individual usage but itll go up to three and a half hours on this box as you can see there is kind of a pain in the rear end but on the backs here you can see some of the other specs Ive got the graphene driver technology for quality sound ultra compact 12 hours of playtime if you factor in the ability to recharge it with a carrying case sweat resistant IP x5 so its pretty much got everything under the Sun you could ask for especially in a pair of earphones that only cost 5999 now you can see theres three little dots there and what those do is they light up theyll indicate how much of a charge the carrying case has but theyre great easy to pair easy to use and super convenient so theyre very easy to pair like I said all you have to do is just take them out of the carrying case and they instantly enter into pairing mode and Im going to demonstrate that in a minute but you can pair them together or if you just wanted to take one out you can pair it individually but of course it works best to pair both of them at the same time when you pull them out instantly it enters pair mode you just pull up whatever device youre using and you can go ahead and connect them that way also one thing I do really like is whenever I pull them out theyre paired you can use one at a time but let me go ahead and demonstrate here so let me get my iPad and Ill bring that over here to the picture put it into a search mode for Bluetooth and then well take the sound cor liberty Neos out and well wait for it to pop up on the screen here and there you go Liberty Neos all you have to do is onestopshop press the button and youre paired and ready to go which is really fantastic because you dont have to worry about a code you have to worry about pushing a button you dont have to do any of that crazy business but like I said once theyre paired you take one out and this is how I use mine most of the time I mean its really nice whenever you can listen to both at the same time but in my office environment Im allowed to use them to listen to music while at work so Ill just pop one of them in my ear and then I can listen that way another nice feature is both of them have microphones built into them so if youre using one earphone or youre using both of them at the same time you can get that stereo audio experience which is pretty good I really feel kind of weird talking on the phone when Im using my earphones but overall its a nice capability that Im glad that they include nowadays so your little ear stabilizers you see theres three sets of these theres a set thats already kind of on the earphone but it doesnt have that little wingtip that protrudes for the extra stabilization so you can pop that right off they are marked so you can figure out which one to use but you have three additional sets that have the stabilizers on them and they allow you to wear the earpiece more comfortably I guess I just used it without but if you for your organ ominous need it and it works out great you have the worlds smallest USB cable I dont know why they always give such small USB cables but its kind of annoying because if you want to plug in your charger into the wall you this thing is barely gonna be hanging off the carpet brilliant touch the ground really but I use I use a different cable that comes with mine so the carrying case works really well I do like the availability to just pop the earphones back in there so whenever youre Im not using them I always put them back in there theyll be charging so any time theyre in the cradle theyre charging which works out well because when you take them out to use them if you want to recharge the battery the carrying case so I have to just plug that in they dont have to have the earphones in it to be charging now you also got four sets of your tips size for your individual comfort I believe its extra small small medium and large I used the default ones actually I did change down to one size smaller just so they they would fit a little bit better but they are available so you can put whichever size you need on for your listening needs now like I said it does have one and a half hour charge time three and a half hours of listening time up to twelve hours of play time if you want to pop them back in and out of the carrying cases you need to use them six millimeter dual drivers and the IPX v sweat and water resistance so you got pretty much everything that you could mean and all like I said for 60 bucks its really a good deal now there is an added functionality with the earphones you can use them like I said you can talk on the phone with them and you can also use the multifunction button so each one of the wireless earbuds on the back there the sound cord logo has a button and all you have to do is just push that button and you can answer phone calls you can hang phone calls up you can press it while youre playing music or watching media and with certain media players it will pause it or it will stop it and if you want to go for the track or backward to track you can just press the button and hold it so that works pretty nice too now the overall sound quality you see little metal filters that they have there that protect the graphene drivers which produce the sound two little pins there which go in the charging case to recharge it the sound quality is actually really good and I was impressed with it not just because theyre portable and not just because of the price but Ive listened to quite a few other of these portable stow and go completely wireless or truly wireless earbuds as they call them and these are probably the most impressive that Ive listened to outside of the Samsung gear buds but youre going to pay 129 for those talking about 59 I recently did get a pair of the Samsung gear buds for my wife because she likes him to go through Samsung phone I tested them out previously and I liked them a lot but for me its not worth 130 investment these are about probably 85 of the sound experience but you dont have to worry about that added price tag and I really think that all around if I were to recommend a pair of earphones at least is this far into the year I would say to go ahead and pick a pair of these sound corny Os up the base carries really well it has a nice thump to it one thing I do like is that its not overpowering you know some manufacturers like to go ahead and make their earphones extra booming or add extra bass because they think that thats what people want to hear but in reality all it does is it just drowns out the vocals and it drowns up highs the Liberty Neos have a very balanced sound experience that complements a lot of different types of music and I listen to predominantly 80s and 90s music but I listen to a lot of different genres within that subset so you listen to rock pop alternative and so much different stuff even classical music the sound quality is very good the volume is good I can put this on like 70 volume and my wife says it hurts her ears me and Im after spending so many years in the military and deployments firearms everything else my hearing is pretty well shot so I turn this up to max and its read it about acceptable for me I would like it to be just a tiny bit louder because I do like to listen to my music really loud but other than that for a normal person Im sure the volume is fantastic like I said my wife cant even turn it up all the way with without complaining that it hurts her ears and having to take them out so the sound quality is good the volume is good the functionality is good easy to pair back to the sound experience the the mids and the vocals are really good and thats one thing its important to me because a lot of times a lot of different earphones they have a hard time producing a quality balanced sound across the sound spectrum and I like to be able to hear the vocals I want to hear this the song is going on not just the beat the bump not just you know the digital stuff or all the other along with it and even on the highs you know the high hats and the different stuff that pops up and comes in and out the sound experience is is balanced and throughout the sound spectrum and especially if you go ahead and you tune it if you use an equalizer and you want to go and balance up the sound experience you can put it to however you would like to listen to it but the chord listening experience is good and it just gets even better if you go ahead and use an equalizer as well which is typically common with a lot of apps not so much to YouTube but maybe YouTube music or use Napster or anything like that theres a lot of different ways you can tune it to your individual listening needs but thats pretty much all I have for the anchor sound chord liberty Neos like I said Im a big fan of them you can pick them up the drug the and the drop down Ive got a link so you can directly go and check them out theyre 5999 and I think that theyre probably the best ones that anchor has made to date so if you want a good good quality sound experience you dont want to break the bank you want all the added functionality the stereo stereo phone calls and all that stuff this is something out how they recommend so thanks a lot guys for tuning in I appreciate it if you have any questions or comments leaving the drop down and I will see you guys

the best noise cancellation in the world Then we obsessed about making it wireless The result QuietComfort 35 wireless headphones Free yourself from wires and connect easily to your devices with Bluetooth and NFC pairing Volumeoptimized EQ gives you balanced audio at any level while a noiserejecting dualmicrophone system provides clear calls even in windy and noisy environments\nThese are our best headphones In making them wireless we had one goal seamlessly merge Bluetooth and our Acoustic Noise Cancelling technology together with no compromise to the technologies or the audio performance were known for Try them for yourselfthen try to live without them\nKey Features\n Industryleading noise cancellation makes quiet sound quieter and music sound better\n Wireless connectivity to your devices through Bluetooth and NFC pairing\n Up to 20 hours of wireless listening per charge and 40 hours when wired\n Premium materials make them lightweight and comfortable for allday listening\n Bose Connect app helps manage paired devices and gives you a personalized experience\nFeatures\n Music sounds better \nYou turn them on and noise instantly fades away Your favorite songs soar to new heights sounding so rich and clear you might feel like youre hearing them for the very first time Its magical to the earbut its not magic Its the precise arrangement of microphones inside and outside the earcups Its proprietary electronics that continuously measure compare and react to outside noises And its the electronics sending an equal and opposite signal to the earcups speakers to cancel those noises All so you can enjoy the music you loveor the silence you need\n Exceptionally strong battery life \nIts thought that battery life suffers with wireless headphones We changed that way of thinking How By customizing the size and shape of our lithium ion battery to optimize the space available in the earcupall without compromising fit or comfort You now enjoy up to 20 hours while using the headphones wirelessly a significant duration for wireless headphones You also get up to 40 hours for wired use\n Quiet sounds quieter \nThe electronic noise floor is another obsession for us A headphones noise floor is that soft hiss you might hear when listening in quiet environments Because that noise is measurable we continuously tweaked the electronics in QC35 headphones until that soft hiss became virtually undetectable\n Premium materials for allday comfort \nMaterials matter Thats why the QC35 headband isnt just soft its luxurious Wrapped in Alcantarathe soft covering material used by prestigious international companies in various applications like yachts and highend automobilesit provides a welcome comfort designed for allday listening The ear cushions are manufactured from a synthetic protein leather and contain a silicone bead for passive noise reduction\n Lightweight and durable How \nThe perception is lightweight headphones are made of plastic and easily broken So we dont use plastic We use glass filled nylon that provides for a lightweight feel but a high level of durability These headphones also have strong finishing touches Stainless steel is used for the headband spring and pivots to ensure the headphones are durable enough for everyday use\n Easy control \nConnecting to Bluetooth devices and switching between themsay from your iPad to iPhone when a call comes inis now delightfully easy The free Bose Connect app manages all connections with an intuitive graphic interface Once paired with multiple devices the headphones will switch between them automatically whenever you want The app also provides software updates product tips and even lets you personalize your settings", "video_like_count": "3760", "video_thumbnail":

gonna say gaming headphones now I wanted to do a short update because I did these a while back these these headphones if you guys want to check out the video I did actually did three videos but one of them hit sixty thousand views and Im still getting constantly views and comments and everything on these headphones so I want to get into these real quick and talk about these real quick so Ive been using these for quite a while now good couple more than couple months like five six seven months Ive been using these for a while and they work great now they do come in five different colors they come in black red green white and blue so if you guys want to pick up different colors go for it I did want to get the whites but they didnt have them at tmobile and thats where I purchased them at tmobile for 99 now a lot of people ask me how do they sound now JBLs makes some great speakers and they do make some great headphones now do I recommend these when youre gaming on the computer no they dont sound theyre not meant for gaming I use these mostly for music or stuff and thats why I said if youre getting a gaming headset get a special gaming headset these are just meant for music and everything I use these all the time now they do have 16 hour battery life to our quick charge so that is great now you guys are probably saying 16 hour battery life now listen Ive been using these gym I take these all the time and Ive been using them I go to the gym like least five days a week with them and I constantly use them for over an hour and I havent even charged them in two weeks so the battery lasts is a lot longer than they expect now these things do are wireless bluetooth now they connect super fast and theyre super responsive now the thing is they do have a wire that comes with the attachment if you want to use the wire you can but why would you have wireless headphones if youre gonna use a wire but just in case they die or whatever so you have that option now the comfort on these headphones I cannot explain how comfortable these are now there are a little bit smaller as you guys can tell they are kind of small and you know they did you look smaller now when they fit they fit perfect they dont move around now I did have a problem with the first ones that I bought they were a little defective every time I kept moving them they would just loose one side would be kind of loose and everything so I had that issue with these but I did return him and tmobile gave me a new pair and I havent had that issue since now like I said before the audio sounds great on these headphones I cant really show you but I can tell you JBL makes great speakers like I said so great heads headphones yes now theyre very comfortable like I said they dont hurt after wearing a periods of time and stuff now they do have this nice cool little JBL logo right here in this nice little fabric soft material so I recommend now someone asked me questioning me before on these when youre sweating and stuff these are sweat proof so you know if you are constantly sweating youre afraid to get these ruined dont worry about it theyre good so other than that these are pretty much good quality headphones now I use these for when I go on the car or I go traveling or somewhere and I take them with me and I just listen to music so these are the only ones that I actually have I do have another set its not JBL its my REO box a company that did send me some wireless headphones and they were great but these are my main drivers I use all the time now people ask me Josh should I go to the beats now my friend has the beats and he said the thing is they are super busy now these do pack a good punch but theyre not super bassy like the beats they these sound great Im just telling you I had a lot of people actually buy these because of my review Im sure the Sonys or the or the Bo are really good but for 99 you cant beat that now like I said if you dont like two small cups you can always get the bigger cups so they fit more around the ear and stuff but yes so these are the e45 BTS so if you guys want to check these out Ill put it in the description below I actually want to do a short little update review on these now real quick if you want to access your phone you dont have to when its on the Bluetooth if you actually right here you can pause play and fastforward all on your headphones so you dont have to go to your phone and drain your battery so its pretty cool you just right there and you can just click it boom youre ready to go to put around the neck and just pretty much bam you as you guys see here my pictures of my little thumbnail picture I have pictured me wearing these because I just love them I like how I just fits around my neck and it stays right there now they do have the left and right on here and they got to charge right there now the charge cable is really cool it does come with the orange with the box so its like an orange color because thats what JBLs color is so these are pretty simple you just connect them and theyre ready to go but thats about it guys I want to do a little short review on these and stuff pretty much I think I went over everything the quick theyre charged about two hours charge and 16 hour battery life so this has a 35 millimeter jack so I mean these are great and you get a oneyear warranty come in white blue green now the green moves to me is kind of like a kind of like a teal so in red so theyre kind of like the bees they have all different colors so guys thanks for watching Josh check him Ill put this in my tech review playlist down below where Ill do an update review on these headphones so other than that these are just great headphones to purchase now Id have Im still getting comments and hits on this

"video_id": "HefY8JwNGCQ", "Closed Captions": " this is so nice highend over the ears headphone featuring active noise cancellation guests your support and more importantly high res audio the package comes included with the soft carrying case micro USB cable for charging and also the miltomil 35 millimeter headphone jacks and you can use the headphone jacks without powering on the headphones if youre going old school and a lock it uses bluetooth 41 for connectivity with support for aptX HD on Qualcomm device slightly higher than your standard apt X now you also have NFC control right here meaning you can tap and sing to multiple devices quite quickly from out as the maximum stable lineofsight astrov meters now this babys right here feature guest your support which is located on the right side with one finger you can just swipe up and down for your volume for selection of your music track is forward or backwards and double tap is for your call function or media controls for agronomy adjustment the headphone features two waist swivel mechanism right here at the hip and expand up to 4 cm usually on other headphones its only 3 cm so this expense 1 cm longer and its reinforced by metal bands right here now aside from that there is a thick padding at the hip belt right here that closed well around your hip now talking about the ear cuffs right here the ear cuffs is measuring overall is 96 cm by 73 cm which the opening is 65 CM by 4 cm with a depth of 2 cm and the overall padding thickness being 15 cm so its really cushioning ish I would say the ear cups is somewhat soft but irritants is structure overall if you see from this video right now and when it comes to the peso sound isolation meaning the hardware although not the active noise cancellation pad its quite good to knock down most of the low frequency noises and mongrels barking in the background now aside from that if I shake my head aggressively of course the headphones will stay in place now when it comes to the active noise cancellation you do need to power on the headphones first before awning and off the active noise cancellation so I wish in the future Sony make it an independent system like other headphones where you dont need to power on the head you can just on the active noise cancellation through a manual switch I think that direction would be wise for Sony in the future update but right now its just a nice implementation even though they dont make that switch now aside from that I would say the active noise cancellation helps to knock down a lot more of that lourd ambient noises and low frequency noises especially I tested this in Malaysia on the noisiest train which is the LRT train system in NOx now all the training weird noise the wheels the track sound it just works really fine this is one of the best headphones for active noise constraint and its better than Bose headphones and I would say its close compared to the a highend Sony WH 1000 Mach 2 almost close to death and it feels good I can sleep in a train and I miss three stops and I wish that when I were in the Train thats how good the headphones is so quiet that it just kills the ambient noise you can talk about the ambient mode function as well no more what means you can hear your surroundings a little bit great for awareness so you dont get knocked down by a bus or kind in the city and another is wind reduction as the name implies now it has other functions and features which one of them is the high res audio that supports audio quality better than your standard CD quality lydic support which transmits more data than your conventional Bluetooth and aptX for better audio quality for supported devices and DC hitch X sound engine that restores high range sound lost during compression this is requiring the Sony hit phone app for you to use it so get that it is brought to life by a pair of 40 millimeter neodymium driver and the rated battery life is 28 hours hour battery life test uses the iPhone 6  v volume bar with noise cancellation on we managed to get 29 hours and 35 minutes with noise cancellation off we managed to get 36 hours and 30 minutes not that bad now for other quality tests for pop in India I chose tnb okay the low base frequency is so public energetic and not above you can feel the air movement in your ears the low base frequency is well body it does not eat into the vocals and he has zero base Distortion the subtle base vibration fit smoothly as well the low bass overpowers the vocals but not to a huge amount to a point in mothballs or push back the vocals behind for PR me Ill do it again the bass is so bubbly energetic and firm you can feel the air pressure once more the bass face butter smooth with the long drag especially at a two minute and a fivesecond mark the vibrations is just your chasm the bass does not overpower the vocals much and it feels balanced compared to the earlier song theres a clear separation between the two the base is well bodied once more and the idiom tones generally sounds fun for vocals and instrumentals we choose violin during drop the piano and violin tone sounds right and natural lean closer to the crystalclear type and not the warm sounding type I prefer the crystalclear type he has the right amount at the highest just right on the tones are well body and it does not sound have had that the bass and drum feels balanced with the piano and violin tone in terms of audible level though there is a clear separation between the two good indication of a balance headphones for patter tonic see true mistress is highpitched Milton on vocals performs well at the highest with the right amount of shine of course it feels bright especially at the 45 second mark each singer can be identified easily every diction and pronunciation is crystal clear vocal big boxing echoing and humming is orgasm which does not overpower mich glasses vocals in the song this headphones performs well when it comes to the low bass frequency to the high frequency ma notably is the piano in a Bonnie tone sounds bright and does not have that warm sounding pie on the little mottling nurse so this headphone suits my taste and needs and youll find this headphones to be very relaxing especially the active noise cancellation knocking off the low ambient noises even the air conditioner on my back right here can you see in the video right Yeah right there it just locks it out and you can just feel relaxed and sleep with this headphones is dis comfortable with this ear cuffs right here and you will not go wrong with this headphones if youre choosing them so you can also purchase them links in the video description for where you can get them and also the pricing comment no wonder Sony products we should review next remember to comment where youre from remember I like to subscribe down with hello channel and see you guys in the next Sony review yay Im hoping Sony gives me the W hich 1000 mach 2 for

now the first thing I want to point out is that is powered by Razer chroma so if you have the other Razer chroma devices like the keyboard the mouse the mouse pad even the speakers now you can sync it up the RGB lighting so that these will coincide with all your other stuff these also have thx spatial audio if youre not familiar with that thats what a lot of movie theaters use for surround sound Applause Music so it should be very good with spatial awareness all right so this is you know typical razor packaging all their packaging kind of looks the same it says for gamers by gamers as you can see this is still a micro USB connection to USB this would be for charging battery life on these you will get 14 hours if youre going to use the chroma lighting on the side and then you can get 24 hours if you turn that off alright so it does come with a headphone cable so you are able to use this wired into you know your phone your Nintendo switch anything that uses a regular threeandahalf millimeter cable both the cables are a braided fabric cable alright so that looks to be it Im concerned while there you know what never month I was gonna say that Im concerned I didnt find the wireless dongle but this is like the Man OWar headset where they hide it into the headset itself as you can see its a 24 gigahertz wireless dongle so youre able to use this into your PC and I will also check to see if it works wirelessly into the PlayStation 4 as well build was it seems as though razors kind of taken the suspension headband along with the hard metal or alloy frame theyve used this on a couple of other headsets underneath its razor embossed on a kind of a leather is material its very soft but again with headphones and ear cups that have this kind of weight you definitely are gonna want some kind of suspension otherwise that would be a lot of weight on the top of your head it does have the cables inside which I am not a fan of simply because its exposed cable this can be cut and then nothings going to work these do not pull up and down they are simply just using the suspension to get the right height on these they do swivel and lay flat but they do not fold inward now ear pad material this is like a micro suede type material right here this is important because this keeps it cool its not the fabric or the leather which you can see on the side or the fake leather or whatever this is its not that on top which usually causes your ears to so this will keep you cool the opening of the earpads are large and and deep so your ears will actually sit inside of here pretty comfy definitely enough give its not as soft a memory foam as some of the other headsets out there but this is extremely soft by the time this is on your head youre not gonna feel clamping force and theyre just really comfortable once again you can see that razor kind of went with the mesh look that goes around on the ear cup and then right here where the Razer logo is this is where your chroma lighting your RGB lighting can change and you do that within the software again you can have it just a one color you can have it Bri the color theres several different things that youre able to do now the microphone on this is actually builtin its on the lefthand side of the ear cup and it just simply extends and has really good Bend so youre able to get it exactly pinpointed where you want but since were talking about the mic lets go ahead and check out a mic test right here alright guys ooh this is a might test of the Razer naari Wireless so most wireless mics I havent found any that has just been absolutely incredible I think that this does a really decent job of picking up tones I think it comes through clearly so as far as playing online you will have no issue with it people being able to hear you you also have a mic mute button on the back part of the headband as soon so as soon as you touch it tip of the microphone turns red to let you know that its muted so that is the mic test of the razer nari wireless all of your controls are actually sitting to the back of the ear cups but lets go ahead and look at those on your right hand side this is the volume wheel it has pretty good tension and it does stop as to wear some headphones just let you keep rolling and you never know where the max is until it hits like a certain tone on the lefthand side you have your mic mute button up top and then you have the control to mix in the game sound with the chat sound underneath that use your power button above that you can see the notification light then you have your micro USB port for charging and then you have your threeandahalf millimeter headphone jack input so overall as far as the looks and the build quality they basically look like they just kind of pulled from different razer headsets to build this but now were going to talk about the sound because theres a hundred and fifty dollars worth the price tag on the razer nari wireless well first off the best way to describe these things is basically the sound fits the look its very big its very bold and what I mean by that is base impact is thick it has a lot of lowend to it sometimes it kind of rolls over into the mid so I felt like mids were kind of pulled back some so that means vocals especially this is more geared on the music side of things I felt vocals was kind of pulled back treble the highs everything came through extremely clear music with these is where I felt like within the app you really needed to go in and try to do a lot of adjusting now it had its presets built in but I felt like going into the EQ and playing around I was able to get more of a sound that I liked now with gaming these things are incredible theyre huge like I said so the bass impact with explosions at running into stuff gunshots things like that youre really able to feel its quite the sensation to have the feeling of bass just hitting every time something like that happens now because of the THX the spatial awareness in this is perfect for firstperson shooters you have a really good awareness where everything is around you now Ive used these wirelessly with the ps4 the Nintendo switch and my PC I dont have an Xbox one to test but theres no reason to think that these wont work overall sound is just exciting its fun the awareness that youre able to pick apart with the surround sound although its not natural surround sound it is trying to push this with just two speakers on your left and right but I was still able to tell Werth what direction things were coming in and had a really good idea of the distance of where people were so for a wireless headset that youre able to use the USB dongle which causes zero lag and able to also use and wire it as well this is a very very nice overall headset I do feel like weight is a little heavy on these I feel like the base is a little booming this is minor nitpicking stuff I dont see any any problem with the build quality I think these will have no problem lasting a very long time so overall this is a very featurerich wireless headset that can cover all Grahams movies they sound fantastic the thx really comes into play there again with gaming it sounds amazing music you definitely just want to listen to in stereo mode the THX surround sound just is playing with in a way that it shouldnt but that is my review of the brand new Razer naari Wireless so thank you guys so much for checking out this video thank you guys so much for checking out all the other videos and as always guys make sure to stay tuned for more",

"QepdoN9zMnM", "Closed Captions": " Music hey guys this is Jayden form is more times and youre watching a quick unboxing our future overview of the sharm is me super bass survivalist headphones these are available at amazon as a part of the primary deal so I instantly bought it because its something new in India this was not earlier available now its launched in the country and these are priced at 1800 rupees there are two options for the colours thats black and gold and black and red so this is the black and red that we bought and these are the major features a 4000 image battery that would give you about 20 hours of playback time since its a Bluetooth one a wireless one you would rely on its battery for the audio playing and that is said to be about 20 hours a 40millimeter dynamic driver for the audio output and its said to offer quite a heavy bass but that will be touching them out for the next couple of weeks at least and I am anyway traveling so youll also know whether these are good for travel and it has a light and comfortable fit and it comes with bluetooth 50 for the connectivity and Ive already taken out the headphones use them a couple of times and I actually like them so far but that wont be the final judgement and theres a charging port of micro USB 1 5v 1a of charging impedance of 32 and net weight of 150 grams so that headphone weighs 150 grams which is actually quite less the emmab is 2199 but its available for 1800 rupees and thats it this is the box package theres nothing much in the box anyway youd see the headphones and then you will see the cables and nothing else would we have seen in there so this is the headphones these are the me super bass headphones with the black and red option and apart from that in the box what you find out these cables and theres a quick manual as well so this is the charging cable which is the micro USB cable that you find along with it and theres this 35 35 cable thats the oxford cable so that in case you want to use it with your phone and not with the bluetooth option you can do that as well thanks to this one so it has the adoption as well in case the battery is dying out and you want to rely on phones battery to play their music on your headphones so thats one addition which is good so you dont have to always rely on it being Wireless this is the user manual that you get along and that would quickly give you an instruction of what all you can do here so there are buttons that can be used for incoming calls and pressing for answer and present whole to decline and theres also this chain by mode press two times and theres also that that would activate the voice assistant when you press it two times this is the music button where you have the volume options and also the play a play and pause button iOS device support battery and volume display but otherwise may not so this might be a disadvantage for the Android ones they might not be able to show you how much battery is left and do not use power bank to charge the me super bass to wireless headphones so thats the warning again you cannot use power bank though I have already tried it with the power bank and it was charging so they want there was not an issue but in case is an issue the company already tells you that you shouldnt be doing it so in case theres an issue that would be a problem for you guys so thats with the box packets coming back to the headphones these are the ones thats the me super bass wireless headphones and they actually feel pretty lightweight and its all plastic to be trying so that is why they are light in weight and they might also seem a bit on the lesser side of the premium that you can call it its they dont feel premium or classy but the good thing that I see here is the ear muffs can be actually more so this thing would make it comfortable and most of the headphones do not have this feature so when these are moving when you place them on your ears this sit there comfortably based on how your head position and the ear position would be and that makes it much more comfortable than the regular headphones and this is on both the sides and I am holding it for a couple of times and I felt they are pretty comfortable and the good thing is that I dont like heavy headphones even though they might be feature filled or they might have a heavier battery but 20 hours of battery life is what the company claims which is already quite good enough and the other thing is that being light they dont ever exert any pressure on your head and ears so thats a good thing here and this is this connecting arm is also quite flexible so that makes it even more easier to wear it for long arts and this is the extendable arm so that is the thats also made of plastic I suppose and thats it and these are the ports the ports towards the bottom of the headphones include the micro USB and the 35 mm headset jack and this is the microphone just beside to it on the side are the buttons there are three buttons in total on this side so as soon as you press this button and hold it for three seconds it would give you the pairing mode and it also says waiting if you are actually wearing it you hear that it first had power on and then said fading so I would turn the Bluetooth on on my phone and then I will try to see if theres any available device on the device and here so this is the me super base wireless headphones thats available for bearing here and and this battery is shown here actually it didnt show mention about that on the booklet it said that it would be supported on the iOS but it shows hundred percent battery here and anyway after using it will let you know whether the battery notification was working or not and you can work with the phone calls media audio and also the contact sharing on this and since that has voice control you can actually give it those voices for the activation and also for some commands now obviously it would take us some time to judge in different conditions by testing out and different conditions and see if the headphones are working well whether the music output is good and whether the bass levels are good enough for the different legendre so well be doing the full review in a week or two and then you will be knowing whether these are but Ill tell you what the form factor I did like the form factor here because of the light weight and then these earmuffs that are quite easy to shake move around and fit to your ears and so thats that about the me Super Bass wireless headphones these might be good for the price because 1800 rupees you see quite a lot of options already in the market but these coming from a brand that is known for doing good in the Access Department I would trust this or easily but then yeah well let you know in the final review so this was it about the me Super Bass wireless headphones I hope you like this video if you rol share and subscribe to and sometimes for more thanks for watching and

pair of on ear headphones Im Erin from tech gadgets canadacom and for Best Buys blog and on ear headphones have never been a favorite for me since I dislike the fit and the feel of them generally speaking but this season after I tried a whole boatload of gear including speakers and some other headphones from Marshall I found myself loving the brand so I set aside my prejudice and clapped on the Marshall major three onear wireless headphones for this review I spent a weekend with them and heres what I found an early heads up though that if you liked this video and find it helpful please hit that like button and consider subscribing since it does help me keep buying music on iTunes these headphones much like the portable speakers and the Marshall monitor headphones have a definite retro look with cushiony looking ear cups wrapped in leather look vinyl fabric and copper accents like on the multifunction button these are vintage but modernized the major threes are collapsible and fold up into a fairly compact package so you can travel with them easily theres also a microphone builtin so you can take calls the first time I tried these on I have to admit I was quite surprised about two things one is that they were comfortable even pressing on my ears they felt soft and surprisingly cushiony second there was a lot of sound isolation sound isolation is the blocking of outside noise using a physical barrier like cushions or padding where noise cancelling is a digital process that cuts sound fleed these headphones have a lot of power to stop most sound bleed and that was a really pleasant surprise for me now getting these headphones set up and paired was easy to get them paired youll push and hold the small copper button on the left ear cup for about five seconds at first youll hear the sound of them powering up but keep holding it for an extra few seconds then youll go to your phone settings menu then to bluetooth and look for the Marshall Monitor 3 in your Bluetooth devices list then youll click to connect thats it after my previous Marshall reviews I wasnt surprised at all that these headphones sound really good the bass is quite strong and really resonant vocals were clear and the headphones sound quite balanced if a little thin sounding overall the good sound quality though combined with the sound isolation make them ideal for travel or commuting or trying to work distraction free the call quality on these headphones is great its clear and Static free I was easily able to hear my callers and my callers said that the audio on my end sounded really good to the wireless connection on these headphones seems really strong I was able to wander all over my house and leave the phone in my office and I never had to worry about dropouts or crackles Marshall put a lot of thought into keeping the design of these headphones clean and streamlined the small copper multifunction button is a chameleon push it to power on or to pair click it up or down to adjust the volume side to side in your skipping tracks a quick press when theres an incoming call will answer it and then hang up and a double press will send it to voicemail these controls are simple yet natural and intuitive after your initial pairing the Marshall Monitor bluetooth headphones will reconnect to that same device once you power them on again I found this worked really well though I was a bit disappointed to see that they cant be connected to more than one device at a time basically like my phone and my tablet I will frequently be using my tablet and listening to something my phone rings and I want to take the call and its nice to be able to switch between them cant do it with these ones the Marshall major three onear wireless headphones have a declared battery life of over 30 hours of playtime on a single charge now my test period wasnt long enough to fully drain them so Im going to have to take Marshalls word for the battery life on these ones overall though these are pretty great headphones they sound really good to my ears they are reasonably comfortable for onear headphones and I think they look pretty retro cool too if youre looking for a pair of vintage styled on ear premium headphones I think youre definitely going to enjoy these they sell for about 199 Canadian and you can get them of course at Best Buy if you want to

amazing Im gonna show you all of that so lets go ahead and begin okay guys so lets begin and the first thing you need is an iPhone or an iPad because this process also works with an iPad if you want you running iOS 131 or later I honestly recommend 132 but it also works with iOS 131 okay and if youre using an iPad iPad OS then 131 or later okay so thats pretty much it so if youre updated to the correct version youre gonna be able to do it so of course theyre gonna need to open bluetooth and then Im gonna manage your devices because were gonna need to actually connect to both your headphones so both the headphones you want to actually listen to okay so both at the same time this is a very important thing for now this process only works for Apple branded headphones or earphones so I have here air plots and then the Beats Studio 3 so 4 beats actually you need to have a slightly newer beats so beats they have the h1 or w1 chips okay so like these ones so in the future Im sure they will work with any headphones or or our earphones but for now only with Apple branded earphones okay Bluetooth earphones or headphones alright so I have them both here because they have been previously connected of course so then all you have to do is connect the air pots so then for the air pause you can just like open the lid and then remove them from the case okay the normal process okay so there you have it theyre connected as you guys can see and for the beats all you have to do is turn them on so Im just gonna turn them on right here so theyre on as you guys can see we of the LED and then theyre not gonna connect automatically of course because you already have the the airport right there so youre gonna need to manually connect them so both of them are on one of them is connected which is the airports and now all you have to do is open your control center okay and then youre gonna like tap and hold on this card right here for your audio and then tap on airplay as you guys can see and then I have both my headphones right here alright so as you guys can see I can just actually go ahead and tap on one of those and then I have the option to share audio so it is connected to my airport as you guys can see it is not connected to my beats yet so all I have to do is share audio and then share audio with the beats as youre seeing right there so share audio connecting so now its connected to both devices as you guys can see and then there you have it its connected to my airports and it is connected to my beats and as I showed you I can individually select the audio the volume amount that I want so so thats pretty much it but of course you want to see it in action so let me show you in action so Im gonna open right here a YouTube video so this is a YouTube video of myself of course and then Im gonna play it alright so it is playing and then Im just gonna show that the audio is coming from the airports let me let me put the volume in maximum okay so you guys can hear from the microphone so volume in maximum and here from the airports can hear it Im put here on my microphone and then from the beats so beats right here Im putting here next to my microphone so as you guys can see theyre coming from bump from both devices at the same time and of course it works on any actual audio audio thats coming from the iPhone so YouTube Apple music Spotify absolutely anything

showing you a really cool pair of wireless headphones from Motorola these are the pulse Escape Plus and this is what the headphones look like and theyre very very comfortable and lightweight to wear and they also have some fantastic features so lets take a closer look they are primarily made of plastic they offer up 20 hours of playtime on a single charge also passive and noise isolation very very lightweight thanks to their plastic construction but theyre really well made weve got a nice amount of padding across the top here as well weve also got a charging point on this ear cup plus you can use them wired or Wireless thanks to this threeandahalf millimeter audio input weve also got a little microphone just down here as well so you can use them to actually take a handsfree call that interrupts your music and then weve also got some track controls on the side here so weve got volume track skip play pause and also multifunction button here so we can pause the music and take an incoming call plenty of padding around the ear cups as well their course will adjust for different sized heads and I sort of strong ratchet mechanism here and then weve got Lee also polished piece here this is still plastic I think very very nicely made and then if youre traveling they will actually fold down into a nice portable package now something else thats really nice is these are in fact water and dust resistant so you can wear them on the beach without having to worry or perhaps youre sort of doing some sort of sports or outdoor activity these are really very very nice for that sort scenario with regard to audio quality a nice rounded sound from this the bass isnt too heavy so they dont go ultra low but certainly the midrange frequencies and high frequencies are very convincing indeed nice and smooth vocals nice and naturally sounding we regards to the passive noise isolation I think thats just down to the fact that theres plenty of padding here so you dont get much sound leaking out and it does cut out some of that exterior noise from your surroundings these are the motorola pulse escape plus I think theyre really good option and a great design pair of headphones from

102246632333", "video_id": "t3ET9IqCi84", "Closed Captions": " Music Ive always had a bit of a lovehate relationship with truly wireless in your headphones theres no denying how useful these devices are but I just havent found one that I really liked the ones Ive tried usually either suffer from poor audio quality poor battery life or poor connectivity sometimes all three and of course it really doesnt help that my ears are just so picky when it comes to in your headphones because so many of them just dont fit but then I got to try Sonys brand new WF 1000x mark three headphones and lets just say that they are actually incredible now I guess I shouldnt be surprised because Sonys no stranger to the audio game and the WUF 1000x month threes are their latest entry into the truly wireless headphone segments but theyre entering the market in a little bit of a disadvantage right now because truly wireless earbuds have been around for quite a long time now and a lot of smartphone makers like Apple and Samsung have their own variants that you dont work well with their smartphones youve got the Apple earpods obviously sort of toothbrush in your ear design theyve got a galaxy butts which I actually have been using for quite a while now in fact theyre right here these low guys so these are the galaxy bugs you can see really smell truly Wireless also and working well with a smartphone or mobile device is crucial when it comes to something thats all about portability because people are almost always going to use something like this with their smartphone however if you look at Sonys current track record with smartphones you can definitely see that they are a little behind their competition which means that they cant leverage that convenience as a strength first thing about the WUF 1000x mark 3 besides having a longer and more complicated more difficult to remember name is that these have something none of those earbuds and that secret sauce is something called active noise cancellation or ANC yes that magical thing that some headphones are able to do to almost entirely drown out loud ambient sounds which is why Im in this really noisy train somewhere in Japan traveling from a shinjuku to Chichibu because Sony doesnt want to just tell me that their new headphones are good they actually want to show me how good they really are now if youre unfamiliar with what active noise cancellation is its not the same as passive noise cancellation you know the kind of isolation you get just by getting a pair of headphones to fit tightly in or over your ears active noise cancellation actually sees the headphones hype a specific second sound thats designed to cancel out stuff like ambient noise so a good pair gets quiet like really quiet this is possible on the WF 1000x mark 3 because it has sonys very own HD noise canceling processor called eq n1e working in tandem with a couple of microphones dqn 1e is able to detect ambient noise in your surroundings and then immediately cancel them out traditionally anc is a feature youd find on large overear headphones so the fact that sony is able to do this on something as small as the WF 1000 x mark 3 is already very impressive but what is truly spectacular is the quality of noise cancellation youre able to get for my money the best anc headphones in the market right now are sonys very own WH 1000 X Mark threes and what really impressed me was how much of that experience the company was able to transfer over to a pair of headphones that are just a fraction of the size the smaller WF 1000 x mark 3 headphones have pretty much the same noise cancellation profiles you have the ambient sound mode that actually pipes in audio from the outside then you can turn off and see if you want to save battery and finally you have noise cancelling turn it on and you get a kind of sound its almost like the noise is being sucked out of your ears but of course it doesnt mean that youre completely isolated from all noise ENC as magical as it is isnt magic it works best when your ambient sound is constant so sudden loud noises dont get blocked as well and as good as they are DW f 1000 x mark threes I still dont think that theyre quite on the level of the larger WH 1000 X Mark threes almost by design these earbuds are already a step behind their over ear brothers I dont know if youve eaten anything with in ear headphones on before but youre chewing and slurping sounds really loud your own voice is also amplified as is your walking and breathing and these are not problems youll ever have to face with over ear headphones but of course the tradeoff is that the Oh your cans are much bigger in size still the fact that theyre able to retain what I feel is about 80 of the anc capabilities of the bigger hip phones is truly an impressive feat however while ANC is cool and all these are still first and foremost truly wireless earbuds so it would be pointless if they sucked at being headphones lets start with audio quality now dont be mistaken these arent designed to sound like inear monitors and when I asked Sony about how they tune their headphones their answer was that they wanted to give users the best enjoyment when listening to music and lastly I think they sound great so Ive been using the Samsung Galaxy buds for quite a while and theyre basically my only in here truly Wireless pair of headphones and I always thought they sounded quite lame but I wasnt prepared for how lame they actually sounded compared to this the WUF 1000 X Mark threes have a very full and rich sound to them that indeed makes music listening fun the bass line is front and center without being overwhelming and that does a lot to make things sound funny they have that Sony sound signature to them in a way that makes them sound a lot like the larger WH 1000 X Mark threes but you know I wouldnt call myself an audiophile I just know what I like and what I dont and I think a lot of you will like how these sound too of course with inear headphones the important thing to get the full experience is to ensure you have a good fit I was probably the most nervous about this aspect because if they didnt fit then I wouldnt be able to review them but you can really tell that these are highend headphones simply by the number of ear tips that they include in the box you get four pairs of silicon tips in varying sizes and three pairs of foam tips to boot thankfully after a little fiddling I finally got a tight seal largest silicon tip I really appreciate it when manufacturers go to these additional lengths just to make sure everyone gets a good fit so kudos Unni that being said there is one aspect about the ergonomics of these inear headphones that I dont enjoy the headphones have a little bit of an L shape to them and when I wear them securely the little corner of the L actually pinches the small protruding part of my ear that google tells me is called the tragus I didnt notice the pinching at all while I was wearing them but when I took them off after a couple of hours my ears were actually really sore and thats a shame because for the most part these ear buds are actually really comfortable but again not all ears are the same shape so you may never encounter this problem with that out of the way lets move on to connectivity and battery life sonys WF 1000 x mark 3 headphones take a little bit of a different approach when it comes to bluetooth connectivity rather than connecting to one but and then relaying the sound these Sony headphones transmit audio to both earbuds simultaneously which they say helps reduce latency another common problem with Bluetooth buds I was a little skeptical at first but I have to say that the connection was very solid throughout my testing Sony lets you switch between two connection modes in their smartphone app allowing you to prioritize either sound quality or a stable connection in my experience sound quality works well if youre not moving through an area with a lot of wireless signals like you know during my train ride but when I was walking through town I had to switch to prioritizing a stable connection otherwise the audio would cut out very frequently in general though I really didnt have much to complain about when it comes to connectivity it hardly ever cut out for me when I was prioritizing a stable connection but the audio quality still sounded fine to my ears plus when I was watching videos on my smart phone I didnt really experience any noticeable delay between the visuals happening onscreen and the audio that I was listening to there was only one instance I think where the earbuds were a touch but simply resetting the connection fixed it for me so Id say that when it comes to latency Sony really held up their end of the bargain unfortunately I cant say the same about battery life so any quotes up to six hours of life on a single charge with ENC turned on but in my experience I was getting a lot closer to five hours I mean its still pretty darn good if you consider the fact that other earbuds of this kind get about the same amount of play time without a and C one unique thing I noticed about the WF 1000x Mark threes is that these buds dont run out of battery at the same rate and if one site runs out earlier you can actually still listen to the other side which I guess is kind of neat I thoroughly enjoyed my time with the sony WF 1000 X Mark threes I think they sound great they are well built and theyve got some of the best active noise cancellation that Ive heard on any pair of headphones I also grew to like the way they look and how securely they fit into my ears despite not featuring any wingtips or straps I tried my best to shake them off with intense hit banging but ultimately was unable to of course its not perfect I think the case is also a little too big to not feature wireless charging and if you were hoping to wear them in the rain you might want to reconsider because these dont come with any IP or splash rating I did wear them in a drizzle in Tokyo once and they turned out fine but I cant recommend that you do the same but at the end of the day I think the biggest thing that will give people pause when considering buying these headphones is the price tag 949 again thats a lot of money for a pair of headphones especially one like this I mean if you compare it to stuff like you know I see buds which are like half the price even the airports are cheaper but none of those have noise cancellation so how important is that to you thats really important then this is truly a oneofakind product and its a oneofakind product that really really works and thats not something you can say every day sure there are quite a lot more expensive but that extra cost isnt for nothing its not like youre paying a batch tax or anything like that youre paying more because these can do more and when you look at it that way I think theyre worth it you", "video_title": "The best active noise cancelling truly wireless headphones  Sony WF1000XM3 review", "video_comment_count": "1640", "video_dislike_count":

and today were looking at another pair of blue do headphones these ones are the f2 fate the second generation oval over ear design which is primo because Im liking the over here I mentioned before I was actually talking about on ear and I were and I actually said over here I want to apologize now Im not going to make that mistake again Im only human anyway so these ones are bluetooth 42 they do have active noise cancellation just like all the other blue Tios that weve weve reviewed here which is great and they work fantastically and Im definitely going fantastically is that a word it is now and Im going to test out the fantastically ANC you can actually connect the two devices at once these have about a 16 hour in use battery life which thats pretty good with only an hour and a half of charge time and not only that but a standby time which means basically its turned on and its just sitting there its not doing anything theres no signal going to it 650 hours of just sitting there so if you forget to turn them off vector flow technology which basically means that it has good air flow it allows it to it sounds good this is all broken down for you go ahead and pause that and just memorize this were going to have a were gonna have a pop quiz later lets open it holy okay I was not expecting that look at this thing that is an actual case fantastic box its got a carabiner on there for those who have been watching for a while Ive got it down now these are carabiners very cool case nice red pepper its a solid case its not like super hard but its a you know cut that its tough those look pretty mo okay first off it actually comes with a pouch for the cables this must be some really good cables we got a about a four and a half foot 35 millimeter to USB C type cable and then we got a four foot USB to USB C type and these are heavyduty thats that flat cable I love these or die so strongly took really good capable down here for now were done with you pouch cool alright headphones oh boy oh man they came all especially packaged and everything like that they got a nice foam cover around them okay so weve got that synthetic leather I yeah no yeah synthetic leather very cushioning this is going to be very whos going to be a comfortable set of headphones okay so it looks like all of this is made out of aluminum when you go to adjust it you can you can find your number super cushiony ear pads I love a good cushioning ear pad on the main unit youve got your anc switch so yeah its got a little power so when you turn that on your active noise cancellation comes on then you get your power button your USB C port that looks like your microphone and your upanddown volume oh my god these are great oh yeah and it look good I mean I make these look good but they look good lets try that active noise cancellation oh I just kicked in Wow oh its so weird and you can still hear stuff but the like all the ambient noise is gone blue TOF as a booyah thats actually not too bad since I didnt see any information on how far the distance is Im going to just go ahead and test it want some line is tech tips all right okay so over 50 feet with absolutely no skipping no jumping nothing solid really solid signal like a phone go call my girl hello hey you can hear yourself oh no bueno but how do I sound though I mean other than other than that do me a small favor you just call me right back and just just to see if you can hear yourself hello can you hear me okay can you hear yourself no okay cool awesome all right that just must have been a weird signal whatever okay cool so she said they sounded really good she said that it didnt sound like I was on anything so the microphone is actually really good comfort wise Wow the top here very very cushiony very comfortable you could definitely use these for a long period of time the ear cushions extremely comfortable I mean look how cushiony and then lovely those are its definitely going to last a lot longer than some of that stiffer stuff I mean you could tell by feeling it that its made with the with some love for sure sound wise okay so Ive heard louder before they dont get like super loud I was able to crank it up and enjoy it just fine the highs in the mid that both give those like an 8 now the bass is low and smooth its not real punchy its not real its not real heavy its kind of heavy sound so that I give an 8 also the design I think is really cool I like the slick all black and metal I mean you could tell they used good materials with this headset I gotta say blue tio again Im enjoying blue tio headphone theyre fantastic theyre wellmade theyre comfortable you can tell that theyre made out of good quality materials this thing as a distance of I dont know what but its beyond 50 feet or so but anyway

"video_id": "_VoHMTJkyWU", "Closed Captions": " hows it going everybody welcome Atsui dudes heck now the HS 70 pro is Corsairs latest upgrade to their HS 70 year budget wireless gaming headset that was released around a year or two up back the age of 70 Pro is retailing of around 80 dollars or a thousand six hundred grand which doesnt make it one of the more affordable wireless gaming hits its again and actually run the same price as the avoiding elites which also took a look at a while back so these ones do compete against each other as well but they do look different and also feel a different but I think eyes want to see a full comparison between Adisa to subscribe because Im going to make a comparison video comparing the HD 70 Pro to the void elite or Wireless soon so yeah check out for that now I will mention that I did not review the HS 70 when it was released but to my knowledge pretty much all of the first generation a chase headsets has the exact same a bold and material so I am going to compare it mostly to the H is a 50s that I do own that are for viewed and I get to my knowledge there pretty much going to be the same as the first generation but just keep that in mind overall there are really that many differences between a DHS a 70 and the H is 70 Pro you still get the more simplistic design which honestly do prefer its much more a subtle but you still get the same adjustable metal frame that allows for a reason amount of a flex and a twisting the frame is still unfortunate thinner metal connection between the headbands frame and the ear cups frame which a might be a potential a breaking point if you are roughly for your headset but of course if you do take care of your raises and thats not going to be a problem I havent dropped the H is a 70 a few times from off the table and theyre honestly still completely flying same goes with the HSTs so the bulk construction isnt really a drawback for these headsets so of course just dont chuck them at the wall if you do have some rage going on in game also just like the previous models you do still get the exact same controls on the ear cups themselves where you do have your volume scroller your mic muted button and indicate your led the detachable mica port and then also the power button comfort wise you do so get the quite a thick about a hardhead bands of padding at its hop but he does see my Corsair wink with a thicker cushions but with a different letter writer material I do like that they are a thicker it makes it a much more comfortable does a better job of making a seal around your ear and then also most importantly it does reduce the amount of ear scratching against the driver of wall that was honestly the biggest complaint that I had with the previous hs7 headset where my ears would scratch against the driver of wall now I am a prone to that issue so if youre a nut then of course this doesnt apply to you that much but I am a glad that I did add the thicker padding to reduce that somewhat is still not entirely gone my ears still scratched a tiny bit against the driver wall but its a lot better as full venule leather right there padding they use on any cushions it is a much softer compared to the previous versions but I do also feel like they do get a bit of hotter as a will currently it is a summer here and if you do not have your aircon on then they do get a bit toasty after a while now as for clamping force just like the previous versions its not enough to crush your skull but just enough to prevent the headset from falling off too easily now as for connectivity the only way to connect to this headset is by using the 24 gigahertz USB adapter which is nice it does allow for a much lower latency for a gaming with that 24 gig impaired  like a bluetooth but because thats the only way to use it you cant use it with a 35 millimeter a jack either with your phone or just connect it to your PC and then also the included micro USB is only for charging it doesnt allow audio pause through through that you cant charge it and then use it wirelessly but yeah thats the only option is Wireless with the 24 gigahertz receiver so definitely dont lose that thats for the wireless range just like the previous version it is around a 40 feet which in real world scenario is around you moving to one or maybe two rooms away I was able to get around a one room between a double breaker bowl without any issues and even sometimes going outside but not too far of course but its mostly for indoor use anyway also just a mention dont put the USB receiver behind your PC or below anything because it might lose connection or have some audio drops so yeah just keep that in mind as well moving on to Bachelor life Crusader states that it does have 16 hours of a use but in reality youre probably gonna get around 10 to 12 hours I was able to get around 2 days of partial use without needing to charge it again so its definitely good enough then getting into sound quality it looks like Chris Harris still using the exact same 50 a millimeter neodymium drivers compared to the HS seventies which Ill see do not have any complaints on they do sound quite good with a decently balanced frequency range but it does have a tad a bit more at a little lower end which Ill see kind of do prefer for a gaming headsets as for gaming you do of course have your virtual 71 option if you wanted to enable that in the PC but afore she it doesnt work on PlayStation 4 only for PCs so then Im moving on to the microphone you do get a nice detachable available a mic with a nice wind muff as a well which can take off but its going to help reduce some of those pops and this when the hotter the microphone now the microphone looks to be a tiny bit different compared to the previous HS 70s mic but yeah I dont think its gonna be that much necessarily again I dont have the exact mic to compare it to but they do say that this mic does have a noise cancellation boards in so you guys can hear how it sounds there is some noise in the background going on outside but nothing like too crazy and then also you do have some some room or some hissing going on but its also not too crazy now lets quickly just type on a chair makes a brown switch keyboard over here so you guys can hear how that sounds so it is still quite unnoticeable so the noise cancellation isnt necessarily the greatest but luckily inside like OBS or stream labs you do have your annoys gates and so on that you can apply to help reduce that anyway but all in all the microphone definitely isnt a bad its good enough to just a chatter for your friends maybe if you want to stream you can still use it but of course external a USB microphone or condenser microphone would be best for that then finally just for the IQ software you do have the standard controls that alike adjusting your EQ settings your mic and side zone of volumes auto shutdown and then also seeing your battery alive nothing too crazy there because also again in the states it doesnt have any RGB which is probably a good thing so the in conclusion the i270 Pro is definitely one of the better wireless a budget at gaming haters currently on the market just like the head with Hs 7c and I wouldnt say that you need to sell your HSA ability to buy the newer version it does have that big of a differences between the two but a nice little upgrade that I did add wasnt much appreciated now just like I mentioned with the ACS of 50s when I reviewed these ones the headset is almost a perfect the only graphs that I still have with the HSM NT process of well is that my ears do still scratch against the driver wall I would like to see some padding against that kind of like you get on the HyperX clouds theyre super comfortable and I just add a tiny bit of extra padding against the driver wall so your ears dont scratch against that and ear Tates you so that is one of things and also finally they could just add a 35 millimeter jacket  they hate it so that if you wanted to take it in public or somewhere else you can actually use it on your phone or whatever and still be able to actually listen to music or watch movies on it something like that just using it in wireless mode you can use it with a USB adapter but honestly just adding a 35 millimeter jack I dont think its that big of a problem but now thats pretty much it a big thanks to Coursera for sending the HD 70 pros over for review again subscribe if you want to see me comparing the the agency materials to the avoid elites to consider again pretty much the exact same price point so subscribe for that but anyway thats what you guys if you did enjoy this review please like share for crabbin comment like always and then I will check all of you

working at home and even doing any sort of exercise outdoors you will appreciate some of the features that were included in this package at two hundred dollars these headphones are prized as a premium product and thats exactly the first impression you get when you look at the packaging but before moving any further lets do a proper unboxing Music apart from the headphones the package also includes a microUSB charging cable a 35 millimeter audio cable a few manuals a carrying case and a 12month premium membership to the underarmor MapMyFitness app taking a closer look right away you will notice that these come with a very nice rugged texture I cannot speak for longterm durability yet but from a build quality standpoint these feel really nice and I can tell they can take the wear and tear workouts or sport activities you get the JBL and Under Armour logos on both sides of the device on the very top you can see the own there are more branding its a little dark to see on camera but it actually looks really nice overall you will notice a black and grey theme which Im very happy with but keep in mind theres another version available which has a black and red combination it is always good to have different options available looking at the inner headband you will notice the unique on there are more fast dry and fabric which is perfect for the gym or outdoor activities and I have to say it is very comfortable as well the ear cushions are also made of the same fabric and they can actually be removed in case you want to rinse them off after a workout moving on to the buttons and ports if you look at the bottom of the device you will see the microUSB charging port on the left side on the right side you get an additional port in case you want to use the provided audio cable the small tabs are a little difficult to remove but I do appreciate the fact that they try to keep everything a sweatresistant as possible on the right side you will find the power button which you have to hold for 2 seconds to turn the headphones on or off volume controls and a playpause button which also allows you to take phone calls on the go another special feature about the underarm or train headphones is a talk through technology essentially if youre working out and youre trying to talk to or listen to somebody else you can easily press on the underarm or logo located on the right side of the device and the audio volume levels will immediately be lower allowing you to listen to the other person so theres no need for you to remove your headphones at the time now lets talk about performance to be clear by the time and draft in this review I have been using these headphones for about a month and a half for weight training and cardio workout to the gym so I have a pretty decent idea of how they perform as somebody that enjoys working out five to six days a week I also understand and appreciate a lot of the features included in this product from a sound quality perspective these are a big wind the underarms or train headphones offer a rich bass experience and clear and loud sound levels that will really help you concentrate on perform on your workouts and lets be clear youre not going to get the same bass and audio quality that you find another high in on ear headphones on the market but when it comes to sport headphones these are definitely on the top of their class they are comfortable relatively light and they offer a very secure fit I found these better suited for weight training or similar activities you can use them for running or for other cardio workouts but personally I usually go with lighter less bulky headphone options for any high intensity cardio activity battery life has been outstanding JBL claims up to 16 hours of use on a full charge and you can get one hour of workout time when just a five minute charge which is very convenient I thought the power cable included was a little short but this is not a major issue the Bluetooth connection and range has been pretty solid so far some of the negatives about these headphones include the lack of noise cancellation technology and the lack of sound settings customization through the use of a gap at the 200 price point these are features that you will normally spec in todays market overall Im very happy with the owner armoire wireless trained headphones and this device has become my favorite accessory for my weekly workouts Id recommend you go ahead and check them out I hope you found this video helpful and if you did dont forget to like this video and subscribe for

noise and Im here with a new pair of premium true wireless earbuds these are the sennheiser momentum true wireless two and these just maybe the best new to elysee earbuds on the market today like the original version of these these cost 300 I know that sounds like a lot but the air pods do cost 250 and you do get more for your 300 than you did with the originals sanitizer has made some upgrades you get active noisecancelling like you do with the air pods Pro I didnt think they were better than the air pods proferred noise cancelling but theyre certainly in the same ballpark the battery life for the originals was around 4 hours of these are up to 7 hours of battery life and you get an extra three charges from the battery case bringing that total to 28 hours the other big improvement is that the call quality or the headset performance of these is better than the originals theres an added mic here theres one for your voice theres a beep a couple of beamforming mics as well as one for the active noisecancelling and what I did noticed when I was out on the streets of New York City is that the noise reduction is significantly better with these than the originals so people can hear you better even in noisy environments these do look very similar to the originals but Sennheiser says it has made them slightly smaller theyre 2 millimeters smaller and that does help with the fit the originals were a little bit big and now these are slightly more comfortable and you can wear them for longer periods without getting any sort of pain that said I cant say these will fit everybodys ears equally well I was able to get a tight seal with the largest ear tips this is a larger earbud even with its slightly reduced size and it wont fit everyones ears equally well Sennheiser has not added wireless charging these do not charge wirelessly theres a USB C charging that you charge quickly they have a quick charge feature before I get into sound quality just a couple of other points about the design these do have touch controls and you can program those controls in the smart control app that Sennheisers free app for iOS or Android you can also turn off active noisecancelling in the app or a transparency mode that lets you hear the outside world there are a couple of other features in that app for instance you can turn on side tone for making calls that allows you to hear your voice inside the earbuds thats a nice feature to have one of the complaints about the original version of these was a battery charging issue when you left the earbuds in the case for a long period without having the case plugged in and charging both the case and the earbuds would drain and you would be left with a pair of dead earbuds Sennheiser has fixed that problem these now go into a deep sleep mode when theyre in the case and they dont drain at least thats what Sennheiser saying I have tested them and it doesnt seem like theyre draining over at least a couple of days so on a sound quality these really are among the best sounding true wireless earbuds out there right now if not the best the originals were  these have the same seven millimeter dynamic drivers nothings changed there they do sound as far as I can tell very similar to the originals they really are a richer sounding headphone than something like the air pods Pro theyre just more articulate the bass is better and theyre just overall significantly better than the air pods Pro these are right up there with the very best sounding true wireless earbuds you have models like this Sony WF 1000 X mark 3 I would say these do sound a little bit better than those and you also have it 350 the master amp dynamic MW oh seven plus this also I think sounds better and fits slightly better thats also a very good headphone but really this is a topnotch sounding true eyeless earbud also with active noisecancelling Sennheiser has made those improvements particularly to the call quality and then you have that better battery life this is really a great true Wireless earbud the only problem of course is that it does cost 300 but if you are in the market for a highend model like the air pods pro or these I would say the air buzz pro are slightly more comfortable they are lighter but this does sound significantly better Im David Carr for cnetcom thanks for watching", "video_title": "The bestsounding true

up Sound Blaster Jam review Lets do it Whats up guys welcome to MyTechMethods My name is Andy This is my review over the Sound Blaster Jam Bluetooth headset So if you know me or youve seen some of my videos before you know that Im a big fan of wireless devices Anything without cords or wires Im a big fan of Im also a big fan of Sound Blaster products as Ive done a couple reviews of their Bluetooth speakers in the past Thats why I wanted to do this video review of the Sound Blaster Jam Bluetooth headset and as always for your convenience I will leave the link to the best price on Amazon in the description below so you can check that out if you want to get these headphones These are wireless headphones but not only can you connect them via Bluetooth you can also connect them via NFC if you have an NFCenabled device For me Ive just been using the Bluetooth option because I have an iPhone 6 Thats all Ive been using as Ive been testing this headset for the past week The Sound Blaster Jam headset comes with a red USB cable so this is how you charge the headphones I really wish they came with a power adapter so you can charge them anywhere but it just comes with a USB cable and thats how you charge it You can charge it through a USB port on your computer But the cool thing is you can use these headphones to listen to your computers audio while theyre charging if you want to do that After the first initial Bluetooth connection to your device these headphones will automatically pair with your device in the future when you turn it on and Bluetooth is enabled on your device so that is good Theyre very easy to use You just use the button on the right side of the headphones Its an allinone button You can hold it down for power on and power off It also has a play and pause button and volume control buttons on the side of the headphones as well so you can control your device right there from the headphones on the right Now lets talk about the two best features about the Sound Blaster Jam headset The first best feature is the battery life The battery life is extremely long When I first got the headphones I charged them for about one hour and since that onehour initial charge I havent had to charge it since Ive been listening through the Bluetooth connection for about 15 hours 860 minutes to be exact So 860 minutes of Bluetooth playback from my iPhone 6 using the Jam headset and I havent had to charge it since So the battery life is extremely long That is one of my favorite features Now my second favorite feature about the Sound Blaster Jam is how lightweight and comfortable these headphones are The first thing I noticed about the Sound Blaster Jam headphones is that they were made entirely out of plastic and it felt kind of cheap It felt like I could probably break them in half if I tried but the plastic is what gives it one of its best features and thats how lightweight these things are When you put these things on you dont even know that youre wearing them theyre so lightweight At one point I wore these for about 5 hours straight around my apartment and I had absolutely no ear strain at all whatsoever when I was wearing them I completely forgot I was wearing them They feel like air on top of you That along with the soft padded ear cushions for your ears make these so comfortable to wear I wore these like I said I wore these around my apartment wore these to the gym on a treadmill working out playing basketball shot basketball in them No problem whatsoever Now lets talk about the sound quality on the Sound Blaster Jam The sound quality is pretty decent for how small these headphones are and how lightweight they are and how cheap they are Now obviously these dont produce the best most highquality crisp sound like you would hear from something like the AudioTechnica ATHM50s for example because those our professional studio headphones and theyre also priced a lot higher than the Sound Blaster Jam In that mid 50 price range youre not going to find much better sound quality than what the Sound Blaster Jam gives These headphones have a Bass button on the right side of the headphones that when its enabled it gives you a little bit of a bass boost within the headphones And I myself was not a big fan of that because when I enabled the bass boost it seemed like it boosted it a little too much for my liking When I was listening to hiphop songs the bass was just overpowered and got to the point where it sounded a little bit distorted for my taste So I usually listened to songs without the bass boost on Thats just my liking but if youre a bass head and you like that bass that uh uh uh then youre probably going to like the bass boost feature And the headphones also have a builtin microphone so when people call you can just answer right from the headphones itself and talk into the microphone thats on the headphones Now when I tested the microphone out I used it on my iPhone 6 to call somebody else on an iPhone 6 and they said they could hear a slight echo whenever I was using that microphone on the Sound Blaster Jam And yes I tested it myself I was the caller on the other end and I could hear a slight echo whenever somebody was using the Sound Blaster Jam so I dont know if that was because of the microphone on the Sound Blaster Jam how the way it is or just my connection from both of our iPhones But there is a microphone built into these headphones that you can use for calling So overall Im a fan of the Sound Blaster Jam Bluetooth headset I think this is going to be my goto headphones whenever I go to the gym or workout or I need something quick to grab to listen to if Im going to grocery shopping or something and I want to listen to a podcast I will probably put these on Obviously theyre not going to replace my professional studio headphones that I use for video editing but these are perfect if youre looking for a pretty cheap Bluetooth headset that is extremely lightweight that has a long battery life and is very comfortable So if youre looking for those features in a Bluetooth headset the Sound Blaster Jam is a great choice I hope you guys enjoyed this review If you want to check

microphone out I used it on my iPhone 6 to call somebody else on an iPhone and they said they could hear a slight echo whenever I was using the Jam microphone I dont know if that was because of the microphone on the Jam or just my connection from my iPhone But there is a microphone built into these headphones that you can use for calling\n\nOverall Im a fan of the Sound Blaster Jam Bluetooth headset I think this is going to be my goto headphones whenever I go to the gym to workout or if Im going grocery shopping and I want to listen to a quick podcast Theyre not going to replace my professional studio headphones that I use for video editing but these are perfect if youre looking for a cheap Bluetooth headset that is extremely lightweight that has long battery life and is very comfortable \n\nSubscribe httpgooglRqU0nl\nTwitter httpTwittercomslye\nFacebook httpFacebookcomMyTechMethods\nGoogle httpgooglWHzrbV\nInstagram httpinstagramcomslye\nWebsite

thank you guys for joining me thanks for joining my community and Ill see you guys at 5000 subscribers Music whats up everyone this is your boy El Jefe and Im back here with another headphone review for you guys now this one Im super super happy with and Im excited to show you guys this these right here are the Edifier w8 30 bt headphones but you can find these guys on amazoncom for about 60 999 let me tell you theyre worth every freaking penny now Ill be sure to leave links to that right down in the description box below make sure you guys check those out and also want to give a special shout out to the subscribers and viewers that suggested these Edifier headphones to me man Im telling you I couldnt be happier now before we go any further and for full disclosure I went ahead and bought these headphones with my own money for the purposes of this review so with that being said lets dive right in Music all right so lets get into the pros and cons of the Edifier w8 3 0 bTW first up and most importantly you guys know how I roll its gonna be the sound quality these are freaking excellent I put these on first try them out right out of the box pop them on put on my favorite songs you know to do all my testing with and crispy clear sound I mean your mids are nice and warm the highs are super crisp and clear and man the bass dude like I just wasnt expecting it the song the first song that I listened to with it starts off with a lot of vocals and like sounds and stuff shout out to my boy Travis MCP if you dont know this dude Ill leave a link to his channel right up here if you want to check him out he always uses this DJ snake and a lot of gorge song you know you like it its a toad song for testing you know hes kept talking about it so I was like you know what let me give this song a shot to test out these headphones and see what the hype is man its an awesome song I test some headphones with and it starts off low but then that bass drops and man these Edifier man they blew me away so as far as the sound quality goes Im gonna have to give these a 45 out of 5 its not a perfect score and more on that in just a bit secondly we have the comfort man these are incredibly comfortable so theyre very like you know you dont feel you dont feel weighed down by them and then they also dont have you know any of that crazy clamping force where its putting all that pressure on your ears and stuff none of that going on and then theyre also very generous in the padding on the headband and on the ear cups themselves so I mean you barely feel them on your head they really got that down as far as the amount of clamping force and I usually have issues with clamping force because I have such a large head so you know Ill put them on stands they can be she tired after a while it usually gets better for me after headphones have broken in you know they do loosen up a bit over time so that gets better for me with these so its not gonna be an issue because they sit very lightly on my head and Im a huge fan of that so just based on how light they are and all the cushioning and the comfort overall theyre getting a 5 out of 5 on that comfort next up youve got the battery life now theyre claiming a 95 hour playback time obviously I have not been able to test that now out of the box they had some battery to them not sure how much but they have some battery to them Ive accumulated around 14 hours worth of total playback time so far havent had any battery warnings havent had any volume issues so as far as battery life goes Im gonna say its good although I havent managed to pull that 95 hours out of it obviously I dont know who could pull in 95 hours of battery life you know in a short period of time but battery life so far pretty dang good so as far as that goes Im gonna have to give them a 45 out of 5 just because I havent been able to pull that full 95 out of them its not a fault of their own but you know just to be conservative four and a half out of five next up you have your microphone quality now these the microphone quality frickin excellent Ill just make a phone call and talk to them when I talk to my wife Ill talk to her and then at the very end Ill say hey how do I sound can you tell that Im talking to you through headphones as far as these data fires go she couldnt tell the difference between the microphone on these and the microphone on my samsung galaxy s 8 so thats pretty dang good picking it up you know they said there wasnt a ton of background noise or any of that stuff and then when I called the restaurant that I called shout out the Flossie Carter for giving me that idea you know they heard me perfectly I was able to place the lunch order and there was no issues so as far as the mic quality goes yeah baby 5 out of 5 so next up and what I think is a major plus is the fact that theyre also foldable and rotatable so you know you can fold them up and youve also got the rotatable cups so if you want to rest them on your shoulders when you take them off your ear stuff like that versatility you know of the way they fit and feel so to me thats a major win you know not a lot of headphones even eat a lot of headphones where theyll do one or the other but not both get foldables or rotatable but these are doing both doing it well and yeah man I think thats a major win for these so Im gonna have to give them a 5 out of 5 just on that versatility alone in the next step out of the box and which i think is a really nice touch especially for a head film in this price range is the fact that they also included a nice case so they give you a nice hard shell case they also included your cables for charging and your threeandahalf millimeter audio cable so its a nice that they threw all that stuff inside especially the case thats a big thing for me I like to keep my headphones nice and safe and yeah I just wish more companies would do that so big ups to Edifier for throwing that case in and then that brings me to the one negative thing which I thought it was a little weird about these headphones and that is when you use them in Wired mode so in Wired mode its a little its a little bit weird so the volume level stays the same you know you you still got really good volume they get plenty loud but the weird thing is that there is a sound profile change almost as if the EQ is different when theyre wired versus being you know going Wireless so by the EQ change what I mean is it seems like theres less treble and more base when wired which kind of threw me off you know because they sound really good to have a good bass when your dues and Im a wire in a wireless mode and you know you get all the crispy high as a great mids and you know and good bass and everything you wire them up all of a sudden the bass is boosted but you lose your top end you lose all that all those clear crispy highs so thats kind of a weird thing its very odd its a very odd thing I have never experienced that you know usually with headphones that have any sort of loss of sound quality when wired its usually just overall volume with these its just like an EQ change which i think is very odd I mean they still sound decent but yeah I just thought Id point that out to you guys if you guys are people that like to run your headphones in Wired mode theyre gonna be in Wired mode theyre gonna be Basie you know its gonna be heavier bass and a little bit less on the treble so in my personal opinion they sound far better in Bluetooth mode than they do in Wired mode so thats why I have to throw that in the con section so as far as wired goes Im gonna have to give them a three and a half out of five just because of that weird EQ change and you know the loss of the Chris penis and the highs so all in all Im super happy that you know you guys suggest that these Edifier headphones to me the sound quality the comfort the microphone quality I mean everything is just awesome on these now I got super lucky I picked them up when ollie Express was having a big sale on these I think I got these for right around 48 ish dollars and I mean it took about a month for them to come in but still it was worth it for those price savings but that said even had I paid the full 6995 er check out the Edifier W 830 BTS these things are freakin legit and theyre definitely getting that El Jefe stamp of approval 100 El Jefe approved right here alright people so Im gonna go ahead and wrap up this review right here let me know what you think of these Edifier headphones have you guys tried Edifier

102246632735", "video_id": "pHNfNIf3sNQ", "Closed Captions": " this is the Samsung level on wireless Pro and as should be immediately apparent its a pair of wireless bluetooth headphones while youve seen many of those this pair as active noise cancellation as well as a 24bit ultrahigh quality audio mode only compatible the select Samsung phones that make this a good pick for a loyal Galaxy fans Im Stephen shank with fawn arena bringing you my full review of the Samsung level on wireless pro headphones Samsung first introduced its level series of audio accessories back in 2015 but lineup thats included models like the level in earbuds level over heavyduty headphones and these the level on wireless pro while theyve been around for a little while now this spring picked up a pair alongside the new Galaxy s8 thats been putting their performance to the test the level on wireless pro is a lightweight folding pair of stereo bluetooth headphones both earpieces twist and turn independently of the headset body and like the band up top are covered in a soft leather like material on the left earpiece we find an analogue in Jack for connecting to non Bluetooth devices while the right side contains the bulk of the controls weve got the microUSB port for charging power and bluetooth pairing switch and a toggle for maybe this headsets most interesting feature active noise cancellation what about volume these are headphones right Samsung pulls the neat trick of building a touch sensitive surface into the side of that right earpiece so ive upanddown for volume left and right for track advanced and tap to pause it tends to work well but wed appreciate some more feedback like a tone or something to let you know when youve reached max volume initially the headphones are pretty comfortable but we found that after just a few hours of listening they really didnt play nicely with our glasses pressing the arms and comfortably against our head you can always take a break or maybe you dont wear glasses at all but its worth keeping in mind setup is as straightforward as any bluetooth headphones should be and you can absolutely just use this pair as is but to get the most out of them youll want to install the Samsung level app which lets you configure EQ settings setup notification prompts and check them the headphones battery status if youve got a compatible Samsung phone and yet this feature is Samsung only you can also use the level app to engage the ultrahigh quality audio mode which interpolates output up to 24 bits per sample thats this models one big selling point and Ferengi eights the pro edition from the regular level on wireless headphones without that engage the audio from these headphones is quite nice and while youre free to augment it with the level apps sound allied EQ all you want its really not worth your effort and when you finally activate ultrahigh quality audio things suddenly sound well pretty much exactly the same honestly that shouldnt be surprising as you cant accurately restore fidelity lost in an original 16bit recording and few listeners even have ears so keen as the teleview could since things sound good already thats no skin off our back but it does tend to put a damper on the whole point of this Pro Edition were more interested as though in the active noise cancellation and this really does make a pronounced difference when engaged youll still hear a lowlevel white noise but background noises you tend to train your brain to ignore stuff like fans or droning mechanical sounds suddenly vanish into nothingness the suppression here isnt quite as strong as on some competing headphones but its very very satisfying all the same the only frustrating that came in the form of a recurring clicking noise wed only hear in the left ear piece and only with noise cancellation turned on battery life is reasonably strong with the level on wireless Pro rated at 10 hours of playback with noise cancellation engaged or 20 hours without our only complaint there is the only way to check on battery status is through the Samsung level app and even then its only a simple icon style readout that said gives them a charge after every a few listening sessions and you should be just fine Samsungs level on wireless pro makes for a decent set of headphones theyve been out for a little while by now so its already dropped in price in the initial 250 to more like 170 now compared to something like Bose that may sound like a good bargain but you do get what you pay for well B sound good we have heard better and were a little concerned with how comfortable they are in the long run also that Im fortunate how the ultra high quality audio mode doesnt do more to enhance the listening experience if youre on a budget you wont be too upset with Samsungs headphones but if youre already spending this kind of money maybe think about spending a little more for something just a bit more robust Im

Jabra has been kicking ass when it comes to wireless headphones they were world leaders in the semi wireless headphones game and now they have no less than three pairs of truly wireless headphones out Im Erin for tech gadgets Canada comm and I recently had a chance to try a pair of their newest this is the Jabra elite 65 T I got to spend a few weeks with them and heres what I found these headphones are engineered for calls and music as opposed to sports use theres the elite active or the elite sport for that and you can check out my review of the elite sport here on the youtube channel or on the blog Jabra elite 65 t headphones appear to be designed for office workers or commuters who need to take calls handsfree or who want to listen to music at work or on the train Jabra says these headphones have been designed to have crystalclear audio theyve got four microphones built right in and thats supposed to reduce ambient noise when youre having a conversation and cut back on wind noise Jabra elite 65 t features an IP 55 rated design meaning theres limited protection from lowpressure water and dust you can also push and hold the multifunction button on these earbuds to get instant access to your phones digital assistant whether thats Siri or Google setting up the Jabra elite 65 T was easy to do it just make sure the right earbud is turned off then push and hold the multifunction button on the right earbud for five seconds until you hear connection instructions inside the earbud and the LED light flashes blue release the button and follow the voice guided instructions to pair your smart phone this will involve going to your phones Bluetooth menu and selecting the Jabra elite 65 T to pair conveniently the earbuds turn on right away when you remove them from the case and theyll shut down when you replace them I really like this feature since it helps prolong the battery life and speaking of which that promised battery life on these headphones is up to 5 hours of battery on a single charge and up to 15 hours in total with the included pocket friendly charging case to initiate a charge just put the earbuds back in the charging case and close the lid theres an LED light inside the case which doubles as a meter of source which will flash red yellow or green to indicate that your buds current battery status itll take you about 2 hours to fully recharge them conveniently theres no need to start and stop the music with these with a button or with your smart phone once theyre in your ear theyll play and as soon as you take one out it stops when youre done whatever youre doing put them back in and the music resumes automatically you can adjust volume on your smart phone or device or on the earbud theres two tiny nibs on either side of the left ear bud pressing the front nib brings the volume down and pressing it towards the back brings it up you can only control the volume when the sound is playing pressing the left button otherwise well get you a verbal battery report there are a set of extra ear gels in the package but where some manufacturers will give you almost a dozen different ear tips gels and fins with Jabra youre really only getting three sizes theyre small medium and large one pair is already on the headphones two more in the package trying these on I noticed theyre significantly less tightfitting than the elite sport version which is pretty ear filling and can get a bit uncomfortable these have a nice normal natural fit the with that feeling comes a little less security and more concern of potentially having them fall out that went away quickly enough though and I never had an issue with the buds coming loose on me the charging case is nice and small and easily fits in a pocket I did find the lid a touch sticky to open since it closes pretty securely and theres not much of a notch to pry it open with the other thing about this case is that its got a rounded bottom so it wont sit flat while its open which is mildly annoying if you have the desire or the need to just use one of these ear buds at a time you can the right earbud has the capability to be used all by itself I tried the Jabra elite 65 tee with a bunch of different music and in a few different environments overall I was really impressed with the sound quality listening to more vocal forward tracks the voice was clear and distinct the bass was pretty good too not bonerattling but I had more of a true sound to it than a vibration it was solid and pleasant overall the sound was clear and crisp there was no distortion or muddiness even at higher volumes and even at 70 percent volume it was still pleasant to listen to jabbers hear through technology uses the builtin microphones to hear whats going on around you and direct that into your listening space if you choose now you can turn this on or off using the Jabra app or you can double press the rate multifunction button and thatll shut it off or turn it on as well Jabra really touts the wind resistant properties of these headphones and I had a chance to try this out for myself on a very windy they recently pop them in my ears and went for a walk and made a few phone calls I asked the callers on the other end if they could hear any ambient noise or any other noise and they all said they couldnt I was actually able to hear the wind blowing past my head and whipping around around me but to my callers on the other end complete silence so chalk one up for Jabra I tried watching youtube videos on my Apple iPhone using the elite 65 T and not surprisingly to me there was a sync issue where audio and video werent quite matched up now this is very common in truly wireless earbuds but its frustrating for owners because it limits what you can use the headphones for interestingly I tried them next on my macbook laptop and they worked great now Im not sure why theyd be able to sync with the smart phone and in sync with the computer because Im not an engineer so if anyone knows if this is a jabber issue an Apple issue software or something else please post in comments below when I was using these headphones close to either my phone or my laptop I had no problems with them no connectivity issues and no dropouts unfortunately that didnt last when Id get up and walk away from wherever they were connected to I was really only able to get about 17 to 22 steps away from the device wearing the headphones before I did start to notice dropouts and the music or the sound cutting out overall it was pretty impressed with these headphones by and large I found the fit to be really comfortable the battery life was excellent and the sound quality was really good as well the hear through technology worked really well so I could let in background noise when I wanted to or block it out to focus the 65 t were easy to operate simple to understand they had easy to interpret lights and buttons that were intuitive and worked well if I was going to make some improvements to these headphones it would be to increase the connectivity and the distance Im able to get away from my device before I was experiencing dropouts but overall I think these are really good headphones and I think theyd be a great mid priced option for people who are looking for something fully Wireless now they sell for about 219 canadian you can find them of course on Jabirs website or from places like Best Buy as well if you want to read more about the Jabra elite 65 T head over to tech gadgets canadacom Ive got a full review written there and you can ask me

"wFJT8w77UA", "Closed Captions": " hey guys welcome to my channel in this video today Im gonna be showing you how to pair your Bluetooth wireless earphones with your iPhone device so the first step that youre gonna want to do is youre gonna head on over into settings so go ahead tap that Settings icon now once youre in settings head on over to bluetooth make sure bluetooth is turned on and the next thing that youre gonna want to do is youre gonna grab your Bluetooth earphones so Im gonna be demonstrating this with three earphones so first up we have the Origin HS threes so youre gonna find that onoff button on the earphones on the wireless earphones youre gonna go ahead and tap it and hold it until you see a blue and red most likely a blue and red flashing light as you see here now once you see that you know grab your phone and youre still going to be in the Bluetooth settings so youre going to go ahead and search it for the device so it should be all the way at the bottom as you can see I have tons of different devices but Im searching for the origin HS threes or the crazy mix thats what theyre calling it here so Im gonna go ahead and tap that as you guys just saw and now I should be paired so I go ahead and grab my music oh there you guys here let your phones are now prepared now let me go ahead and try that with a different pair of earphones so youre not gonna need to do this every single time you want to pair your earphones to your phone it becomes a lot easier after the first time so basically lets just say that Bluetooth was off so Im gonna go ahead and turn it off and if I want it to pair my earphones again back to my phone I would just basically turn bluetooth on and it should pretty much automatically pair as you guys will see in just a moment so now if it doesnt happen to pair then what you do is you just go back into settings and in the Bluetooth setting list you should see the earphones so for example the origin crazy mixes so we just tap on that and it would pair as you guys can see so it becomes a lot easier after the first time now next up Im gonna go ahead and try this with the meizu EP 52 so again youre going to search for that onoff button its usually in the middle and Im gonna go ahead and hold that until I see the blue and red flashing lights there you go now Im going to head back into the Bluetooth settings by tapping on that Settings icon and in bluetooth Im going to make sure that radio button is turned on so as you can see all the way at the bottom here I have that makes you EP 52 so Im going to go ahead and tap on that and it should now pair and as you guys will soon hear I will be playing some music out of these earphones and there you go now lets go ahead and try that the last pair of headphones that we have here that is with the blue do headphones theyre the turbines so on the blue do turbines were gonna go ahead and find that onoff button it should be here somewhere its usually near the right near the LED so it should be right here actually so were gonna go ahead and click on that sometimes you may have to hold the button for a little bit longer than five to eight seconds sometimes its like ten seconds and sometimes it wont believe sometimes itll just prompt to you so depending on the earphones sometimes the lights wont even blink sometimes itll just hold a steady blue as you see here and its pretty much ready to pair so as you can see Im gonna go on over to my device and Im gonna search for blue do Im gonna tap on that and there we go now Im now paired so though I didnt play a song so you guys can see that or can hear that there you go Im now parent so thats pretty much how you guys do it hopefully this video did help you out if it did please do leave a like thank you for watching and Ill catch you guys in the next one later", "video_title": "How To Connect  Wireless Headphones to IPhone 2019", "video_comment_count": "320", "video_dislike_count": "340", "video_view_count": "72927",

the p15 you have some information on the box you have them in different colors also so this one is black have it in blue and gray in the well more of a like green while light green and gray this one is white and black and the one that we already opened was in red and black so lets take a few second and look around the box it has the information that you need is a wire less headphone some pictures and TF card FM stereo radio mp3 player and Bluetooth because inside you dont actually need to have like a iPhone or any kind of device to make it work just take a SD card put it inside and micro SD actually you put it inside with your music and control everything with it so sit tight Ill show you and you will get a power supply also while a power supply its a charger so lets go ahead and check it out but after that it will work with any kind of Bluetooth device so from 41 and going down it will work to work for up to 10 meters so if you leave this in your home you can go in your backyard no problem tap time you can talk for up to 6 hours with a single charge you will be in standard standby time will be 15 hours and yeah you get some hold on with the N number read out function large and small volume adjustment for it is so you can change the music and everything so lets open it up and see whats inside hold on so we will get some instruction also which are pretty basic so how to use it how you will make it work we also get some cable with this so you can plug it and they will work directly so if you want to plug this directly to your iPod well you can just do it with the wire so even if you run out of battery its super simple just take it out plug it and I will they will continue to work you get your charger which is a standard one so even if you lose the one that you have this one well you can buy it and will cost you around like what 2 bucks so thats pretty dope have that and lets take a look inside the product so nice you can flip it and you can also fold it back and put it in the box or in your backpack and walk with it so thats pretty decent on this one side you have the power on button ok you have the pause and play the next song the song before that you can answer your phone also with this so if youre connected to your phone so you can actually answer some peoples calling you and here is the most interesting part is that you have that little SD slot so you can put some SD card inside with your music preloaded and they will play and its not that expensive around like what under 30 so and theyre pretty constant also and very easy to carry around or in your backpack or you can just fold it if you go out a gym this is the way to go because you wont have no wires you dont even have to have a solar phone actually just preload all the music that you want inside press play and youre good to go you can do all of your gym exercise and it wont affect your like ramen or anything because actually will work so lets take my phone out and connect it right away duh hold on because basically you have it here do too okay Doosan or call the P 15 so right now its telling me that its already connected because I did try it first and lets take some music actually Ill go and I get some copyright free music so wont get knocked ruble P right see music and I dont know if you can hear it but hold on here in the headlights dear not in the headlights see that its working very well but its not even let the music right now so hold on they do work pretty well actually and I can pause it if I want to I can press the next song which you can see here will change so thats pretty nice so if you have like your list inside with plenty music you dont actually have to take your phone out you can just go directly and press it on your head and if I received a phone call right away well like I just answered and they have some microphone on this so people will hear you and everything pretty decent actually for the price its costing 30 people should definitely get one of those not that expensive and the product is pretty cool it do work very well and you have multiple of function on it so even if the battery are dead like I told you just plug the wires and put it in and you will continue to listen to some music so that was the first model I will put them back and well check out the other colors because some people like to see the other colors they are made in so hold on that was the first for second one okay mind you that theyre all well packed so if you give this as a gift where you buy it for a store well you can at least be sure that it will come in a premium package so can give it as a gift no trouble and they will look good and if you have small children at home or like teenagers they will probably have some fun with this Wow green and gray so I have three more color that I will show you today which are pretty decent and its one of those things that you can definitely buy as a gift and people that will receive it will be happy because it has everything inside you also have the FM radio so even if you dont have some music well you know that you have some FM radio this is perfectly black the cutter that I like the most are the one with the two colors on it but depends on your choice some people like to have multiple colors other only some color so this one in but its more of a baby blue actually baby blue and gray so any kind of geeky device that you might have so just have to plug it and search for the PCT and youre good to go actually the last but not least the white and the black which are pretty well packed so

trying to get a good nights sleep and everyone has their own tips and tricks to get to sleep and stay asleep one of those can be listening to things like music podcasts or guided meditations at night but of course if you do that and youve got a husband or a wife you risk keeping them awake with your audio the answer then is headphones but headphones particularly like these can really hurt your ears after a while especially if youre a side sleeper and of course the cords can definitely get tangled up in all the bedding Im Erin from tech gadgets canadacom and I may have found a solution for people that like to listen to something to fall asleep these are sleep phones and their soft padded wireless headphones with little flat speakers inside theyre designed to be worn while youre asleep and theyre perfectly flat so theyre not going to ache or distract you or be uncomfortable I had a chance to spend a couple of weeks testing out sleep phones and this is my review sleep phones headphones have tiny speakers inside the band that sit over and above your ear so theres nothing sticking in your ear all night to bother you Ill give you a little look at whats inside the sleep phones headband here theres a Bluetooth module which is your connection to your phone tablet or device and its wireless its got a couple buttons on it which allow you to turn the power on and off put it into pairing mode and turn the volume up or down and skip tracks it connects via microUSB and thats how you recharge it also in here that little module connects to what are in essence the small flat speakers which act as the earbuds for your sleep phones theyre very small theyre very quite thin and theyre wrapped in this felt so theyre designed to be perfectly comfortable I have to say I didnt have the easiest time getting the sleep phone setup youre supposed to push and hold the square button for about five or six seconds to enter pairing mode youll hear a threetone sound and then some beeping then you head to your phones bluetooth menu and select acoustic sheep a long tone should confirm your connection I definitely struggled pairing the sleep phones to a couple of different devices I tried with both Apple devices and an Android device as well and Id say on average it took me about 20 times to get them paired they wouldnt show up in the bluetooth menu sometimes other times they would show up in the Bluetooth menu but then Id get a connection error I thought this was a bit weird so I reached out to acoustic sheep the makers of sleep phones to ask what gives and it seems that theyre not the best perhaps at pairing to more than one device at a time which might have been the problem so if you want to connect them to more than one device youll either need to shut the Bluetooth off on the first device youve paired them to connect them to your second device and then hopefully thatll work other times you might need to do a hard reset Im gonna put full instructions on how to do all of these things and acoustic sheeps tips and tricks for getting paired on the blog at tech gadgets Canada comm just so we dont have to take up a whole bunch of time with detailed instructions in this video so head over there and check it out if you do need some help when I tried the sleep phones on for the first time I put them on and I felt like they didnt quite fit right I felt like the speakers like they are now were not even close to being above my ear now I can kind of feel where they are inside the band and I was trying to shimmy them forward a bit to get them into the right place but I was worried about breaking the cabling inside I didnt know what was going on so if I can open these up for you and show you theres actually plenty of cable inside so you have the ability to adjust them to quite a large extent and if you just reach into the band and shuffle them along you can move them forward or backwards into the band to get them in exactly the right place so that theyre gonna be perfectly comfortable and the audio will sound great for you one thing I didnt love about the sleep phones is that theres no auto shutoff on these when I listen to podcasts at night typically using my Apple iPad when the podcast is done after about an hour the iPad shuts off and goes to sleep now when I use the sleep phones with the iPad to listen to these podcasts when I wake up in the morning the Bluetooth module would still be on so Im listening to about an hour of podcast and then its basically staying on for the remainder of the night until I wake up and shut it off in the morning sometimes I forgot to do that so I was really blowing the battery on it to me it would be great if there was an auto shutoff feature for the sleep phones otherwise youll have to remember to shut them off each morning the promised battery life on sleep phones is about 13 hours and they do take about three hours to fully charge to charge them remove them from the band and plug in the bluetooth module and youll see a red light when the light goes out theyre ready so you might be wondering how you know when you remove the Bluetooth module from the band to charge it how do you put it in the right way so that you can use the volume up and down buttons correctly the easiest way according to acoustic sheep is to match the logo with the logo on the Bluetooth module so long as both are facing up everything works correctly the sleep phones band is washable and if youve taken the speakers and the bluetooth module out to wash the band heres how you get them back in properly well each speaker has a tiny paper label on it indicating left and right those are pretty likely to tear off so acoustic sheep has color coded the speakers right has red embroidery on one side and the left has green they go back into the band with the white felt side against your head on each appropriate side sleep phones dont make any claims about phenomenal audio quality but I was pleasantly surprised at just how good they did sound the audio was clear and sharp and as far as Im concerned using these for travel or being lulled to sleep theyre just great Id say sleep phones are pretty comfortable to wear and to sleep in Im a side sleeper and as a result Ive never been able to wear regular headphones because I find they just hurt my ears after a while so these are an excellent solution now I do listen to podcasts each night to help me fall asleep and what Ive been doing up until now is playing them on the speaker of my Apple iPad and falling asleep to that which is great for me but not so great for my husband who is subjected to whatever Im listening to when he comes to bed so these are definitely a great solution I can sleep on either side I can move around at night Im not gonna get tangled nothings going to ache or hurt me and I think theyre a really great solution for people who want to listen to audio before they go to bed but dont want to disturb the other person sleep phones can also double as a sleep mask since one of the band is significantly wider than the other if you turn it around you can use it to cover your eyes though youll probably need to readjust the speakers overall I was really happy with my sleep phones I found the band to be really soft and comfortable it wasnt too hot at night I liked the fact that the little speakers inside are perfectly flat so theyre not pressing on my head or in my ear and waking me up I like the audio quality of it I was pleasantly surprised at just how good the sleep sound it if I had any complaints about the sleep phones its that these werent easy to pair and it wasnt clear to me there are limitations on pairing to more than one device at a time now that I know how they work and their limitations its easier but initially it was frustrating I also wish they had a shutoff timer to preserve their battery life overall I definitely recommend sleep phones if youre the type of person that likes to fall asleep listening to audio but you cant stand the distraction of regular headphones they sell for about ninety nine dollars on sleep phones website and theyre also available on Amazon if you want to read more about them theres a full blog online at tech gadgets Canada calm you can head over there and check it out theres also those detailed instructions I was talking about if you do

SleepPhones headphones help you sleep better and more comfortably I spent weeks testing them \nFull review  instructions TechGadgetsCanadacom\nFollow me on Twitter  Instagram ErinLYYC\nSome people struggle their whole lives with getting a good nights rest and everyone has their own tricks for getting to sleep and staying asleep If  yours is to wear headphones to block out noise or lull yourself with meditative podcasts or music you may be one of the ones whos been using headphones so as not to disturb your partner But trying to sleep with headphones can be uncomfortable they hurt your ears and can get tangled overnight SleepPhones Wireless headphones may be the answer\n\nSleepPhones headphones have tiny speakers inside the band that sit over and above your ear so theres nothing sticking in your ear all night to bother you \n\nI have to say I didnt have the easiest time getting SleepPhones set up\n\nI struggled pairing this device multiple times to several devices both Apple and Android Sometimes the SleepPhones would show up in my Bluetooth menu and just not connect Other times they wouldnt show up at all Id say on average it took me about 20 attempts to connect\n\nI reached out to Acoustic Sheep makers of SleepPhones to ask what was up  It seems a couple things could be at play  First they may not pair to more than one device at a time Second they may need as hard reset\n\nOne thing I didnt like is that the sleep phones dont shut off after your podcast finishes They WILL shut off if your bluetooth turns off but on their own they stay on all night and were still on in the AM when I woke I guess thats ok if you want all night distraction but it does eat up battery life meaning I needed to charge them every 2 days or so\n\nThe promised battery life on SleepPhones is about 13 hours and  they do take three hours to fully charge  \n\nWhile each speaker has a tiny paper label on it indicating left and right those are likely to wear off so Acoustic Sheep has colour coded the speakers right has red embroidery on one side and left is green Ive also seen a green felt pad and red felt pad in place of the embroidery in different models They go back into the band with the white felt side against your head\n\nI was pretty impressed with the wireless range of the SleepPhones  I did some tests where I walked away from the headphones while listening I was able to get to the other side of the apartment with walls in between me and my phone and still get a clear signal \n\nSleepPhones dont make any claims about phenomenal audio quality but I was pleasantly surprised at just how good they did sound The audio was clear and sharp and as far as Im concerned using these for travel or for being lulled to sleep theyre just great  \n\nSleepPhones comfort and fit\n\nVO FIT\nI chose the One Size Fits Most band which is actually labelled Medium on the inside  and found it fit me well not too tight and not too loose\n\nSleepPhones are quite comfortable to wear and to sleep in  Im a side sleeper and as such have never been able to wear headphones to bed I do listen to podcasts to fall asleep each night so my solution is to play audio from my iPads speaker on low volume from the bedside table Fortunately my husband doesnt mind but Id rather not subject him to noise \n\nWith SleepPhones I can lay comfortably on either side and still listen to my shows without disturbing my husband Brilliant Theres also no cords to get tangled up in overnight another annoyance\n\nSleepPhones can also double as a sleep mask One end of the band is significantly wider than the other and if you turn it around you can use it to cover your eyes though youll probably need to readjust the speakers\n\n\nI was quite happy with my SleepPhones  Theyre definitely comfortable and I didnt find the band too warm I like the fact theyre very flat and dont press on my head or my ears while Im sleeping on my side Theyre completely distraction and annoyancefree when it comes to sleeping with headphones on\n\nI was pleasantly surprised at the audio quality and really love the idea of these for travelling for blocking out ambient noise or for falling asleep to meditative sounds\n\n\nIf I had a complaint it was that these werent easy to pair and it wasnt clear to me that there are limitations on pairing to more than one device at a time Now that I know how they work and their limitations its easier but initially it was frustrating I also wish they had a shut off timer to preserve battery life\n\nOverall Id recommend these headphones if you like to sleep while listening to music podcasts and more Theyre comfortable easy to wear and they sound great\n\nSleepPhones Wireless sell for about 99USD from SleepPhones website",

hammerhead true wirelesssoundcore liberty 2 pro", "idx": "285", "channel_id": "UCaFGDBmGK_jw66u3av2Ysjw", "collection_date": "20201007 102246633002", "video_id": "KJCDseDOL3E", "Closed Captions": " ever since the launch of the original earpods a few years ago it seems that every company I know is releasing its own version of true wireless headphones to compete against Apples air pods this year Ive tested quite a bit and I narrowed them down to about the top 7 or the more intriguing options that are available and so in this video were gonna go over those sets of true wireless headphones and see which one is worth your hard earned cash before we get started be sure to subscribe and hit the bell to get notifications whenever we share a video so keep in mind Im taking a look at each set of these headphones from an iPhone users perspective and so I broke it all down into about four categories we have comfort Portability  battery life sound quality and then bonus features the headphones that we feature in this video are the Razer hammerheads sound Core Liberty 2 pro the Jabra elite 75 teased the Sony WF 1000 XM 3 and then Apples trifecta of headphones that were released this year in the air pods to the power beats Pro and the newly released air pods Pro so comfort being our first category is kind of a tricky one to start off with what I want to kind of get it out of the way because for everyone this is going to be different because everybody has different ears and what you determine is comfortable might not be the same thing for me and vice versa so for me pretty much every single pair of headphones received an 8 except for the air pods Pro which got a 9 for me I think all of these stemless style headphones sort of fit the same mold and since they are pretty well lodged inside of my ears they tend to hurt more over longer durations of use compared to something like ear pods  or the Razer hammerheads which actually have a stem design and they dont really get jammed that far into your ears they are all comfortable and they all fit securely for the most part but the air pods Pro with the smaller stem have a little bit of a better fit for me and so I think that gets the higher score they do go further in your ear but they are designed in a way to help alleviate any fatigue that might result with a piece of plastic being jammed inside your ear canal and Ive had just a lot less issues with comfort overall when wearing the air pods Pro so I didnt want to spend a whole lot of time on comfort just because like I said its gonna be different for everybody but for me they were all pretty much the same  the air pods prep next up is portability and what I took into consideration with portability was not only how easy it is to transport these headphones around but battery life as well do you need to travel around with a charging cable how often do you need to charge them most of these headphones are pretty portable already and theyre all trying to be a small footprint but some of them dont fit inside your pocket as well as you might think and considering that a lot of these earbuds are small you dont really want to put them in your pocket without a case and some of the cases are monstrous compared to others so for example the wonderfully named sony WF 1000x m3s have not only a gigantic name but a gigantic case that doesnt fit in the pocket as well as something like the Jabra elite 75 Ts and the additional battery life coming from the charging case of the Sonys is actually worse with 24 hours as opposed to jabbers 28 so you probably guessed who scored the best in this category and that would be the Jabra elite 75 Ts because they were the smallest and packed some of the better battery life inside of the case the worst Portability went to Sony WF 1000 XM threes because that case is monstrous and the sound core Liberty 2 Pro is also a pretty solid option when it comes to battery but the case for me is a little bit wonky Im not a big fan of the slideout top that it has and its kind of hard to correctly get your headphones in without really focusing in on what youre doing the last two categories sound quality and bonus features are the most important so well spend a little bit more time on those at least in my opinion theyre the most important because well we want our headphones to sound the best but we also want to have the best features that you can get with those headphones for the price I do want to preface this by saying that none of these headphones sound bad anyway theyre just all really solid options and some sound better than the others so when I say it doesnt sound as good its in comparison to the ones that were talking about in this video so if it gets a lower score dont think that the product is trash or whatever its just not as good in comparison to some of the others that we featured in this video so with that said the champions of this category are the earpods pro and the sony WF 1000x and threes as far as the Sony headphones go sound quality is extremely good out of the box it has some of the best balance that Ive heard aside from the air pods Pro you can adjust the sound profile even more inside of the app which well get into and more in just a minute but with some tweaking you might be able to take these and make them sound better than any other headphones on this list but for those who want a minimal effort kind of a plug and play option the air pods Pro will rank slightly higher because I really just dont think you need to adjust the EQ at all with these headphones personally they just sound really good right out of the box on the lower end of the spectrum we have the Razer hammerhead and the sound cord Liberty to pros the hammerheads again do not sound terrible by any means but its a little too flat for my liking well most of the headphones in this roundup tend to lean more bass heavy which can get obnoxious the hammerheads have a very neutral sound profile but sometimes that lacks in any separation of instruments or just really any punch but if youre looking for that sort of sound profile then youll definitely be happy so for that reason it received our lowest score of 6 now the sound cord Liberty to pros might be the more frustrating option here because out of the box they actually sound pretty good but I think they can sound so much better if I could manually mess with the EQ beyond some presets that the app gives you now maybe Ive missed this but I searched the app pretty well and I couldnt find anything of that sort a lot of the other headphones hovered around the 7 or 8 mark in terms of sound quality with the air pods Pro and Sonys getting the only perfect tense speaking of perfect 10 are only headphones to achieve that in our final category of bonus features are the air pods pro and thats because the only pair to have excellent active noise cancellation and transparency modes alongside the h1 chip which makes the experience way better than any other headphones on this list while there isnt a dedicated app to adjust some of the extra features that you might get the air pods Pro do not need a whole lot of adjusting for example an EQ might be nice for some people out there to further control your ear pods pro sound but its probably not necessary for most of us who use the air pants bro as they sound nearly perfect out of the box and for me personally I dont really need or want to adjust any ANC levels but I suppose that would also be a nice to have the Sony WF 1000 XM threes offer up one of the better apps of the group and its really easy to customize your sound and change between the extra features or customize the touch controls but those extra features arent really anything to write home about I do think the noise cancellation is as good as ear pods Pro and I honestly cannot tell the difference between ambient sound modes whether theyre on or off which is why this section is getting innate because for 229 I expected more to go along with the tremendous sound quality for the Sonys the only place the ear pods Pro suffer in is media playback controls now there are a little bit better with the new stem but you still cant control volume without asking Siri to do so and thats a little bit frustrating for me the power beats Pro got a 9 alongside the air pods too because they share the same h1 chip which is what makes the whole experience really really good when youre using Apple devices but since they lack any other additional sound quality features they wont be quite as good as the air pods Pro the hammerheads Liberty to pros in Jabra elite 75 tees of the world do not come featurerich whatsoever but they do come at a lower price point so if youre not looking for the best of the best but want something that sounds great and it just works then maybe the Liberty to pros or the Jabra elites might be a better option for you if youre a gamer and you want razors ultralow latency feature those might be a great option for you as well especially because they are the cheapest ones on this list and only 99 overall its pretty obvious that in my opinion the air pods Pro are the best true Wireless options out on the market right now they sound better they fit better and have more useful features available but of course they will come at a more premium price but overall in 2019 my favorite pair would be the air Potts Pro and something that I would recommend picking up if youre looking to spend two hundred and fifty dollars so let us know in the comments

you know that since Ive been back with phone Reina Ive been focusing a lot of my time and efforts into covering wireless Bluetooth headphones but not just any kind of headphones instead I have this passion for true wireless headphones of course consumers were really thrilled by this prospect but when first starts seeing the first batch of true wireless headphones we were kind of disappointed by the outcome you had things like poor battery life subpar audio performances and even connectivity issues so made people apprehensive about jumping on the trend thankfully weve seen a lot of improvements just in the last year alone but even after checking out quite a handful of different models whether theyre sub 100 ones all the way to premium offerings I am still looking for the perfect pair of true wireless headphones so when I think about the perfect pair of true wallis headphones the first thing will it comes to mind is their design there are two sides here you have headphones designed for casual music listeners and then you have others or fitness junkies its a tough balance for manufacturers I personally prefer the sporty styled ones just because you have that added benefit of being water and sweat resistant they also tend to stay in the ear a lot better mainly because they usually come with these wingtips that allow them stay in place in the year even with heavy movement I think the perfectly designed pair of true wild headphones would involve these wingtips no matter what style the manufacturer is going after take for example the Apple earpods which is great for casual music listening but terrible for exercising if they offered some sort of wingtips it would drastically improve its overall fit next up itd be really great if all true wireless headphones offered customized equalizer settings the majority of headphones out there have just a single sound profile so youre basically at the mercy of the manufacturer some headphones I checked out offer customized equalizer settings like the jbird run and a Sony WF 1000x I definitely appreciate the variety because not everyones taste is gonna be the same some people prefer bass heavy tones with the lows and then some people like a wider distribution with the sound quality so obviously if they all offered customizable equalizer settings it would definitely be a benefit just because you could finetune the music to the way you like it pretty much all of these true wireless headphones are packaged with battery charging cases not only do they safely protect them but they actively charge them as well problem with the majority of battery charging cases right now is that theyre pre generic with their functionality they basically just charge the headphones and that is it but again there are others that offer more versatility take for example the battery charging case that comes with a broken bit charge stereo not only do I love the way its designed but its also functional because it does feature a full sized USB port you basically gain a battery bank just because you have the ability to charge your other devices as well I actually would love to see more features tacked on to these battery charging cases take baby they could include one that has a wireless charging pad which would come in handy if youre traveling or maybe include their respective cables like for example that jlabbe epic air wireless it has a micro USB cable that wraps around the case for me I think the biggest dealbreaker with most of the true Isles headphones Ive checked out thus far is the fact that they have latency issues everything about them could be fantastic they have all these cool features stellar audio quality but then when I watch a video thats when I get disappointed well it really isnt a problem when youre listening to music its more of a problem if youre trying to use these true wireless headphones for watching videos because of these latency issues you tend to have out of sync audio with the video which is definitely annoying if youre trying to watch a movie I think about the Sony WF 1000x that I checked out not too long ago it was almost the perfect pair because it did offer equalizer settings she had these noise cancellation features and being sound amplification and much more but when it came to watching videos it had a latency issue and that just killed it for me obviously the perfect pair wouldnt have any latency issues whatsoever so everything is in sync next up I like to see more and more features included in these true wireless headphones we have things like noise cancellation which is already available in several models you also have sound amplification which is pretty handy if youre wearing two headphones and your try talk to someone when you turn it on itll actually amplify their voice so you could converse with them those are just two luxury features that we see in some premium headphones right now but I want to see more features like the Google Translate integration with the pixel buds I think it would be really cool if there was some way to actually have those languages saved locally into the headphones so when you speak with someone a different language it automatically will do all the translation for you so you dont need your mobile device Id also like to see more sensors integrated into these true wireless headphones not just heart rate sensors which a few already have but motionbased ones that would offer additional controls I gotta say the search for the perfect pair of true Als headphones continues for me I checked that ones that were very close like the jaybird Ron and its only WF 1000x but I wouldnt classify either them to be the perfect pair but I know were getting closer because just in the last year alone weve seen dramatic improvements in a true wireless headphone segment its even better knowing that well continue to see prices fall Ive already checked out a couple of models that were under 100 which is amazing considering when the first generation true wireless headphones came out they were easily over 300 and that is it for this video guys what else would you like to see in the perfect pair of true wireless headphones let me know by leaving comment in this video and if you guys want to learn more about anything I talked about in this video you could check out our website

under 3000 and its 20 20 time for iteration but this time around lets raise the bar to 5000 rupees so yeah in this video we will be covering me basic headphones bolt audio pro base akg pro k92 jbl 750 btnc sony wh c510 lets start the segment with the most popular headphones of 2019 yes the me super bass wireless headphones and two world review its basic first thing first im not a big fan of on the ear headphones i usually dont recommend them to do one prime reason yes discomfort so with that out of the way these headphones offer good audio quality i mean that thumping bass thats there you will love listening to bollywood songs upbeat music or streaming netflix on it the headphones also offer good 20 hours of battery life provided that you listen at 70 to 80 volume while most of the other headphones offer only 10 hours but then of course you always have the option to plug in aux cable however its something that people dont usually carry with themselves and you wont find headphone jack in most of the smartphones so yeah battery life really helps although if you want to see the full review i will leave the link in the description and then the youtube cards overall the audio quality is decent and the battery backup is close to 20 hours however the onair design really gets uncomfortable after 20 minutes of using so if youre looking for a headphone for small commute this should be fine however if youre looking for a long term usage then consider the bold pro base which is available at same price hey guys a gentle reminder so we are going live on youtube today at 12 pm afternoon to discuss the best deal on amazon your products q a and lots of surprise giveaway so yeah see you there in an hour Music akg pro k92 are not a bluetooth headphones but its still my favorite headphones in the list not only because it has truly over the air design which makes it really comfortable to wear over a long period of time but the audio quality is quite clear and crisp now akg has three different headphones the k52 the k72 and k92 so in this video we have the k92 and the review might mostly hold room for other headphones as well now talking about the build quality these are the largest pair of headphones in the list and the ear cups are truly over the air i can wear it for long hours and not feel any discomfort there is also scrap that helps you to distribute the weight of the headphones on top of your head rather than on the air themselves the only caveat is the nondetachable cable this one for sure is definitely not made to be used outside the house or even when you are on the move now talking about the audio quality its pretty good too the vocals are clear and close to actual music i can easily recommend it to most music lovers or even gamers to give you a perspective we have been using the audio technica m20x and both of them are quite similar both headphones are over the air and great for studio monitoring although do keep in mind both dont have a mic so you wont be able to make calls or use the mic while gaming sure theres a lot of noise leak in these headphones but then again for a reference headphone thats okay overall if youre a musician or a video eater and dont mind extra cables then this akg k92 pro is perfect for you next up we have the jbl 750 btnc i was quite excited to try it out two reasons active noise cancellation and overtheair design but i was disappointed now before we come to that lets take a look at the headphones itself it looks premium and although its made of plastic it feels sturdy on the right ear cup there are power button which works as a blue pairing button followed by volume up down and a button to enable active noise cancellation and for charging there is a micro usb pretty standard stuff however you usually dont see an extra padding in the head area in the budget once so thats nice and the ear cups are pretty soft and provide some good noise isolation now talking about the ear cups although the headphones are advertised as over the ear headphones its not actually truly over the air i wasnt able to use it for more than half an hour i mean technically its over the air if you compare the ear cups with other on the ear headphones like tag or sony but a true overtheear headphone has a larger ear cups like akg ones which perfectly fits my ear but my biggest disappointment came from active noise cancellation i mean i was able to cut the fan noise but it had no impact on the ambient noise or even the people talking i usually use the airpods pro or bros qc35 and compared to them these headphones cancel only 20 percent of the noise other than that the audio quality wasnt that impressing and the thumping bass that jbl is known for i didnt find it here and the battery is pretty average too overall two highlighted features to get this headphones is over the air design and active noise cancellation and it does none of that really well other than that the audio quality and the battery backup is quite decent but then again you can get it at cheaper headphones so in short i dont really recommend this Music an average headphone in this price segment offered 10 hours of battery life but sony ws c510 offers not only 20 30 but 35 hours of battery life now keeping the awesome battery life aside the first thing you notice about the sony headphone is the smaller form factor i mean here is it side by side with bold akg and me headphones and as you can see its quite compact should be easy to put it in a travel bag also if you have a slim body type these will look better on you compared to other bulky headphones but at the same time the smaller ear cups also get uncomfortable after 15 minutes of use like i said not a big fan of on the ear headphones moving on to the right ear cups you have the generic volume up down and power button along with type c yes finally and then there is a mic for calling as well now just in case youre looking for headphones to make a voice call heres the audio sample from each headphones okay so this is the audio coming from the headphones one and as you can listen there is a lot of background noise and cross crawling in the background so this is the audio sample coming from the headphones too with the same background noise and crows crawling in the background and this is the audio sample coming from the headphone number three amidst the same environment and finally the audio coming from headphone number four obviously the same environment the same and finally the audio quality on sony well theres nothing special about the audio quality here i mean its no reversed but there are a lot of cheaper headphones which sounds better than this to me it seems like these headphones are built for people who travel frequently i mean the battery life is awesome it takes less space in the bag and there is also type c charging so no extra cable to keep around overall if and only if youre looking for headphones with great battery backup go for sony other than that the audio quality and the build quality is just too basic for the price not recommended next up we have the bold pro base which files under the same price segment as me headphones but offers kind of overtheair design so it doesnt get uncomfortable like the knee headphones as you can see compared to the me headphones the ear cups are slightly bigger so it will be able to engulf the air better than the me headphones the build quality is quite premium too there is this extra padding for the head area and the leather cushioning for the ear cups now talking about the range it has a range of 10 meters in fact all the headphones tws or neckbands that we have tested in the past one year has the same range which is sufficient to move around in two or three rooms without the drop of any signal its a decent pair of comfortable headphones but in terms of audio quality its speakers are more in the boosted side which means its good for edm or poppy song however for vocals or old songs this is not recommended so finally which one should you buy well this time its more like which one not to buy and jbl 750 btnc is on top of my list its just too expensive for the feature it offers and same is the case with sony headphones the build quality and the audio quality is just too underwhelming for the price it offer the only thing it is good at is the battery backup however if youre looking for a good reference headphone for music production or editing then consider akg headphone they are the most comfortable to wear for a long time and the audio quality is crisp and clear just just that its a wired headphone and if i have to choose between the bolt and me headphones i prefer the bolt pro base it offers good value for money and a decent audio quality with better comfort either way do let me know which one are you gonna buy in the comment section below or if you prefer neckband or tws check out our other videos which will be dropping out soon as always its now signing off thank you for watching Laughter you", "video_title": "Best Bluetooth HeadPhone Under 5000 Amazon Prime Day", "video_comment_count": "2720",

"Closed Captions": " so i got the sony thousand xm3 and ive been using them for about two to three weeks now and i have to say im pretty blown away by just how good these are it checks all boxes in terms of design active noise cancellation features music output and clarity battery backup and even price i think its pretty competitively priced given other products in this price segment now it was launched globally a year back and its launched in india very recently but even in 2020 i think these are just a great pair of earphones to own and i think its very easy to recommend them now ive got my own reason so well pick up a design but first itll be great if you could drop a like hit that subscribe button and that bell icon and help me move closer to my 200 000 subscriber go anyway lets move on and talk about design first the entire unit is nfc enabled so a simple tap with your nfc enabled phone can get you connected the case is probably one of the most unique and good looking cases ive ever seen its definitely bigger than most but again its also better looking than most but in any regular jeans i could easily house them so they definitely take a bit more space in your pocket but i just love how it looks the soft matte finish that metallic bronze copper color satisfying magnetic grab and the case closing it just feels very polished and classy the earpieces themselves look great they have that matte finish and the same copper bronze accents that you saw in the case their size is pretty unique too you know theyre not as big as lets say the bose soundsport or uh the airpods pro you know they dont hang out as much but theyre also not as snug as lets say the galaxy butts plus or the galaxy buds live youve got touch controls to control music playback accept or reject calls and even fire up your voice assistant of your choice you get this whole range of ear tips and this is important for that active noise cancellation to work really well you better select the right tip for your earpiece and you have to really lock it in so that it creates enough of passive seal and anc becomes a lot more effective that way okay one downside to these they are not water resistant so you cant wear them even in light showers or a sweaty workout besides they dont really look like your usual workout earphones though you can totally wear them while youre working out okay so lets now talk about features and lets start with active noise cancellation to begin with there are two parts to noise cancellation one is passive cancellation that is you just have the earphones nicely snug into your ear with the right ear tip that it creates a seal to block half the noise without doing much and then there is active noise cancellation which is where the qn1e chip inside does its magic to block out ambient noise now they do a great job once you hit about 50 or 60 volume you can literally just zone in on the music and not be bothered with anything around you can work in total peace or even if youre commuting outdoors now ive not tested the active noise cancellation capabilities on an airborne flight for obvious reasons but given my experience on ground i can confidently say that they would do a great job blocking out noise even when youre inside an aircraft so if thats what you wanted to know theres also a headphones app that offers you more flexibility and control over your earphones now you could completely do without the app but there are some smart features built in like adaptive sound control where the app would keep track of your surroundings and movement to change noise cancellation strength and levels and even volume and there are some other tweaks that you could make within the app to better suit your earphone usage all right now lets talk about the music output the sound quality and while this is so difficult to explain because its something you really need to feel but heres what ill leave you with the music output its really clean and clear and loud and with just the right amount of bass the music output is just super crisp the beats are just so sharp and pure i can totally enjoy all kinds of music on these your pieces and theyre just plenty loud and then couple that with anc i dont think theres anything you can really complain about now from a call quality perspective i think theyre pretty good theyre definitely better than the galaxy buds plus that ive been using both in terms of clarity as well as volume one issue though the active noise cancellation it does not kick in when youre on phone calls though that would have been great and now lets talk about battery and in general i think all these earphones have great battery backup i mean im not that much of a heavy user so for me they go on for about a week once ive fully charged them now the guys at sony they say that the earphones can give you six hours of nonstop playback with anc turned on and then this guy over here can charge these four times over so thats 24 hours plus six 30 hours with anc turned on and if you turned off anc you could extend that to 40 hours 8 hours plus 32 hours so thats thats great i think and now lets talk about the price the more sensitive piece and these guys are right up in the alley with the both soundsport and the airpods pro so from that perspective given its features and music output i think theyre very competitively priced but its still about 270 or 20 000 rupees which is a lot of money but hey if youre looking at top quality active noise cancelling great sounding good looking truly wireless earphones i would buy them in a heartbeat and even more so above the bose or the airpods pro but thats my personal preference you have to keep in mind these are not water resistant so that may tilt your decisions in favor of something else so thats a decision ill leave up to you but anyway thats my verdict on the sony thousand xm3 the truly wireless earphones if youve got any questions feel free

cables in general and in a lot of ways were going wireless these days we have wireless HDMI for using monitoring systems a lot of WiFi 24 gigahertz stuff our audio is often wireless so the last thing the last piece of the puzzle if you will for me has always been the headphones but its such a necessity for monitoring audio and in a lot of instances it really is a hindrance so itd be amazing to have Bluetooth wireless headphones for monitoring cameras maybe just be able to quickly check audio or completely monitor wirefree so in this video we are going to grab a whole bunch of Bluetooth transmitters and were gonna hunt down the best one for use with your camera so I went out and bought a whole bunch of different low latency systems including a pair of headphones I also have my trusty audio technica BT 50s or em 50s so Im gonna really try to do my best to find something thatll work for us my number one concern is latency I want to make sure its as close to whats happening in real life as possible so test number one its going to be a very simple camera setup were gonna have a transmitter connected to the headphone jack of this a 73 and then were also going to be using a more complicated setup using the mix preowned and were gonna figure out what kind of latency is working because Id love to have an audio bag and just headphones like this that I could put on and Im good to go for monitoring sound so lets get started and were going to start with the cheapest option and work our way up to the more expensive stuff and our first option is this guy right here its just a generic wireless audio transmitter so it has USB for power and then we can flip it around nothing really else going on power button and then we have an output or rather an input for our camera Im going to using this ridiculous overkill battery here but you could obviously use something much smaller some of our future options will not need this so next were going to be plugging this thing into VA 73 but first we have to pair it and for the most part pairing all these devices is very similar you simply turn on or supply power to whatever transmitter youre using then you get your headphones and go ahead and power them up and hopefully they connect to each other and there now its connected got a solid light on the adapter so now Im gonna take this monstrous thing and plug it into my a 73 and put the headphones on and hope that the latency isnt terrible so here we go check one two test one two its pretty bad but 14 bucks so I did the initial test on the camera sounded pretty bad but now were gonna use the recorder to figure out exactly how much latency there is and now youll be able to hear what Im hearing when I put these headphones on so you can see here Ive got a microphone a live mic plugged into my mixer III and were recording what these headphones are hearing so it wont sound perfect but youll get the idea I also have a microphone just off of frame here I can actually lightly touch it here and you can hear that its actually recording there goes a vehicle in the distance and were going to see between the recording of the microphone and the actual recording of the headphones how much of a delay there is now youre not supposed to  and Ill put some information somewhere as to how much that latency is or how long it is so thats our cheapest option now were going to run through all the rest now that we know the testing situation here we can just barrel through the rest of these our next option is this taotronics tiny little transmitter here Im not going to take this and plug it into the a7 3 and as you can see a very nice little tidy setup there so Im going to throw on the headphones well see if this is any better than our last one guys check one two Wow actually this is a little better I think but well find out on the recorder one two you test test one two check check test testing one two check check test next up we have this fox novo transmitter got it right here and this things a little larger so lets bring it over to the mix pre three and see what it sounds like in this is what it sounds like if you were listening to this right here right now definitely still some lingzi heres how much latency there is lets move on to the next item and our next item is the hog abyss hag abyss something like that tiny little transmitter Im really excited and hoping this one works because it would be perfect for our use case and there ladies and gentlemen is our tiny little transmitter whats cool about this one is you can plug it in but it also is flexible so you can kind of create different angles with it which is awesome so Ive got it paired up with my headphones and you can see Ive got it mounted to the camera here and this is the perfect option in my opinion if there was you know low latency weve got this adorable little set up with this little dongle essentially sticking right out of the headphone jack so here goes nothing and putting the headphones on and definitely some latency so were going to be listening to that latency right in our next option is also from the same company a Vaughn tree very similar to that Fox and Nova option we looked at earlier and this is what it would sound like if you were using this solution to monitor yourself and next up we have the Avant reprieve approve of three so were gonna go ahead and give this guy a shot and see if its any good now this and several of these products have something called aptX or low latency csr its just essentially supposedly gonna help with latency and now we have the headphones hooked up with a microphone and were gonna be listening to the audio latency right now now now youre hearing why what youre hearing I was wearing this headphones and as you can tell its not great which is really unfortunate hopefully were gonna find something that works at least better than this and our next item is from the same company but this ones a little different so let me get the box already here and you can see that there are actually two devices here a transmitter and a receiver so were gonna see if this guy is gonna work better than the previous options instead of having a single transmitter like this one where the audio goes in and then Bluetooth transmits to a Bluetooth set of headphones this little silver set does something a little different one of them is a transmitter the TX its going to take the signal from the headphone jack and transmit it to the other little device here which is the Rx this will then plug into a normal set of headphones now you can either use a corded one or use something like you know these headphones I have here in a tiny little cable you could then attach it or tape it or glue it to your headphones so it essentially is turning a normal set of headphones into bluetooth headphones but these are designed to be super low latency so lets go ahead and see if it works Im going to take my headphones here take the receiver and plug it in this was paired out of the box so I just pulled it out of the box and turned them on Im now going to take the transmitter which has that special aptX you know technology and Im going to connect it to my mix pre three and now ladies and gentlemen lets see if this works going to put my headphones on the correct way and oh my gosh for the first time in this video we have low latency thank goodness I was really concerned we get to the end of these and there would be no good options and now well connect a microphone to his headphones so you can hear what I just heard so that should be good enough right there and here is what it sounds like when youre listening to this setup youll hear my voice youll hear the headphones and unlike the previous options this is so much better theres still a tiny bit of latency but for live audio I think this is amazing so so far this will be your best option lets see if theres anything else thats gonna compete and our last set up or our last solution is from the same company of Vaughn tree but this time they have a special pair of headphones that link with this transmitter same technology as a lot of the other ones so Im hoping this one will work alright so lets talk about this setup weve got the headphones here bluetooth weve got the Bluetooth transmitter and were gonna go ahead and power everything up so Ill turn on the headphones Ill bring in a USB battery for our transmitter because it does require USB power I know this is again overkill for something like this I grabbed an aux cable 35 millimeter plug it in now its set to aux now we can pair it up in fact its already paired its just out of the box ready to rock and roll so were gonna take this thing plug into the mixedbreed 3 and see what latency looks like check check check check check okay so this is great this is actually pretty doggone low when it comes to latency just a little bit there but I can totally talk and listen to myself at the same time without my brain exploding so lets go ahead and hook up a microphone to these headphones so you can hear what latency is like all right guys right now youre listening to my microphone going into the mix pre and a transmitted over to the headphones so youre listening to the set up pretty good I think the latency is still there but its definitely not nearly as bad as some of the other solutions we looked at before so we just went over a ton of information a several different devices for wirelessly monitoring your audio so now Im gonna kind of go through final recommendations if latency means nothing to you you do not care and you want the cheapest possible option these little Bluetooth transmitters are fine but pretty much would not recommend them because they dont have a built in battery so unless youre absolutely broke skip this guy dont recommend it the next best option in my opinion is going to be this guy right here the tower Onix transmitter has a builtin battery so you can use it without any kind of USB battery it does have some latency issues but if thats not important to you this could be a great way to go moving up a little bit in cost I love the form factor of this tiny little Bluetooth transmitter the fact that you can bend it into any shape that you prefer is awesome so if youre looking for the best oncamera headphone monitoring system for Bluetooth and latency doesnt matter to you then definitely consider this guy these two larger devices while they do work the latency was still an issue so Im gonna say go ahead and skip those two unless youre buying something for your TV set same thing goes with this guy over here this is a Vaughn tree little round guy and then finally we have kind of the two best lowest latency options that is the Avanti little pucks here which have worked really well and I think this is a phenomenal option and you dont need Bluetooth headphones you can use whatever headphones you want as long as you can plug a 35 millimeter into them and then the other option which is also very low latency was this kit that included the transmitter and the headphones great great low latency option unfortunately you have to supply power to this unit so its gonna be a little bulky for oncamera stuff but for an audio bag this could be a really nice solution now I think this setup right here involves using the headphones if you do use your own headphones you might not have the same results but for 90 bucks you get everything you need to get some decent low latency when it comes to monitoring your audio so I hope you enjoyed that comparison for me these little round things are gonna be perfect for my project that well be talking about here in the future so stay tuned for that on the channel were building a really awesome audio kit so thats gonna wrap things up for me guys thank you so much for watching hope you have a great rest of your day and well see you in the next video Music you", "video_title": "Wireless Camera

I was looking for a nice set of bluetooth headphones and initially I was gonna start cheap like I I love my Amazon basics wired headphones can I find the Bluetooth version of that something cheap very simple very aesthetically clean and I ended up with well not these I ended up with these and while they were cheap like the Amazon basics I liked they werent quite exactly what I was looking for the audio quality is not quite there but I kept coming back to these just because of the aesthetic quality of it I really like the simplicity of it it looks to me like the Bluetooth version of Amazon basics headphone its just a little bit more expensive now the good thing is that I havent seen them for a hundred bucks in a while theyve come down to about sixty bucks which seems like the standard price now 60 bucks okay Ill take a chance on a company like Jabra which I associate job of a Bluetooth but more with like bluetooth headsets for phone calls I never make a phone call I dont need to make a phone call I just need to listen to music and well well find out how these do that job this is a driver box very small very compact as you would expect a nice compact pair of headphones to come in lets see on the side of the box we talked about her features you know the relevant details are that youve got eight hours of battery life which is not great but its not terrible also eight hours is you know a little bit better than youll get from most earbuds not as good as youll get with like those audio Technicas I have I think the battery life on those is almost 40 hours its got a microphone dont care lightweight thats cool music yes calls dont care bluetooth 40 so that is actually kind of an older version of bluetooth it wont have some features like you know being able to connect to two different devices like some other Bluetooth devices have but lets go ahead and crack it open and see whats inside this box Music thats a cute look Wow this is very simple packaging this is just a plastic shell and not even fastened inside of it they just happened to come out is the cables weve got instructions and a warning to contact Jabra instead of Amazon who I bought this from okay weve got a USB charging cable as if I didnt have enough of these and then here is a standard audio cable which these will like a lot of other Bluetooth headphones like this these will work without any power just over a wired connection its actually kind of an interesting thing about these Jabra is that well when you connect it with a wired connection you might expect the audio quality to be at least as good as the Bluetooth if not possibly better just because an analog signal is gonna be better than a compressed digital signal thats traveling through the air and potentially having some interference you know and that is the case with some other headphones that I have like those audio Technicas I talked about the sr5 BTS now interesting thing about these Jabra is is at least according to a very wellregarded blogger  youtuber inter fidelity is that these actually sound worse over the cable they sound better over bluetooth kind of surprising for me its not a big deal because I dont plan on using this cable lets go back to the headset itself which is oddly wrapped in little plastic earmuffs but thats all you got between you and the headphones Music lets give them the sniff test lets see if these things are made of leather I can pretty much already tell you theyre not yep thats synthetic it is a very compact headset the the weight of it is pretty light not super light its not like plastically light like the the Amazon basics headphones that I have but the construction is very simple you know this head headband right here is pretty nicely padded I like that these arms right here are made of a metal you know its probably like an aluminum or some sort of lightweight cheap metal but its a little bit nicer than plastic and I appreciate that now one thing to note about these headphones is that according to a lot of reviews on Amazon people are having experience where the headphone padding right here was splitting apart at this seam right here you can see a lot of pictures on Amazon of people with their headphones that have split right there and that should be a reason why I wouldnt buy these headphones but from what I can tell theyve actually updated the design since then and the newer versions of this have extra stitching in fact you can see the stitching a long hair on the seam that extra stitching is new it used to be just held together with an adhesive and that should hold it together much much better well so lets try it on the old noggin see how left and right nice and clearly labeled so you can see it their small size may be a little small for my big dome so notably the band does not adjust and like clean notches its just very its very smooth and very analog in between all of its different settings so if you are a stickler for having it being perfectly symmetrical and I dont even know why you would be like I dont know anyone whos like that except for maybe me but if you are a stickler for having it perfectly symmetrical between the two its gonna require some eyeballing and finessing theres no like oh I need it exactly three clicks out its a little more analog than that and then when I get to Mon my ears the sound isolation is a little bit better than I expected with a headphone like this is a very small headset comfort wise they feel pretty good you know its its actually kind of funny they are significantly trimmer and slimmer than my audio Technicas but on the head they dont really feel much lighter they dont feel theyre definitely not heavy audio Technicas are pretty compact and lightweight as well but these dont feel any more lightweight when I wear like those amazonbasics headphones again theyre just made of all plastic but they do really feel pretty comfortable and super lightweight you dont feel them on your head at all these I can tell theyre there but theyre not heavy thats about as much as I can say about these headphones until I listen to them so lets dive into some music Music all right so just did a little bit of listening with the driver moves and a couple of notes one yes they sound much better than those thirty dollar mera case bluetooth headphones the bass is all just a tad accentuated its not super bass II but it is a little bit of a seer than some other headphones that Ive listened to a couple of notes about the controls so on your left side youve got a pretty simple configuration of buttons youve got down and up buttons for volume up and down and then youve got a button in the center which controls play and pause and the the volume on the headphones is synced up with my iPhone so unlike some other headphones Im not having to manage volume on the headphones and on the iPhone separately its just one volume setting and its shared between them thats great maybe one downside on the volume is that these dont get super loud they dont get the mirrored case that I have actually get a little bit louder than these these give as loud as I need them to get I dont think its gonna be a problem but they just dont get ear bleeding lis loud and thats a good thing if youre these are you getting these for a kid and you dont want them to bleed their ears thats a good idea if youre an adult who listens to music and you dont want your ears to bleed okay yeah its not a problem theyre not gonna make your ears bleed but they dont get super loud another really good point about these the the power switch is just on or off theres no pressing and holding it to turn it on so its very quick right its as quick as that now its powered on and then I timed it the time between me turning it on and it being connected to my phone was three seconds which is really fast the only other thing I can think to say about these headphones is that they dont fold up in any way you know the the ear cups dont fold flat they rotate slightly to adjust to your head but they dont rotate flat they dont fold inward for you know compact carrying but now they do theyre pretty its just a really small pair of headphones so you can leave them around your neck but if you do need something that you can fold up and pack away tight these might not do that for you if I were to score these at this point and I have to thats what this super review is all about if I had to score these at this point I might give ooh I might give these a five you know the audio quality hmm maybe not quite as high fidelity as those audio Technicas but I you know thats not exactly what I was looking for in this I wanted to sound good enough and they do sound good enough they sound great these are very comparable to the amazonbasics headphones that I have which I think punch way above their weight class they sound great I love how small and compact it is I love the form factor the build quality is very nice its lightweight enough not super lightweight but its maybe maybe the extra heft kind of makes it feel a little bit more premium than something like those amazonbasics headphones but without feeling any fussier its just a simple of a pair of headphones and I like that the functionality and the buttons is everything that I want turns on and connects super quick yeah Im gonna give these five stars and I didnt expect to give them five stars but there you go five stars for the job remove if youre looking to pick up a pair of these sometimes they listed for a hundred bucks dont pay a hundred bucks from Ive seen them very very commonly for 60 bucks and I have a link to Amazon down below where you can see them probably for 60 bucks if you like the super review of the Jabra move wireless headphones you can give me a thumbs up down below and if you want to subscribe to the channel and Ill see you in the next episode", "video_title": "Jabra Move Wireless Headphones Super Review",

recently launched these new super race wireless headphones for 800 rupees now as the name States theyre supposed to deliver superior based on a budget but do they well lets take a closer look today shall we hey guys I hear youre watching Singh for riteca lets get started so first lets start with the build quality these headphones theyre made entirely out of plastic and you can adjust the headband size now that helps you make it a better fit but the use of plastic it is both a probe as well as a con at the same time the con part is that these headphones they dont feel solid they dont feel like a premium pair of cans and well at 1800 rupees you cant really expect them to but given its Xiaomi weve kind of expected the impossible from show me all the time because they do offer great quality products at you know unreal budgets now on the other hand the 150 gram weight does not amount to much its spread evenly so they are comfortable to wear that is as long as you like the on your headphone design me personally I prefer over the your headphones Im okay with Anya I dont dislike it or anything but if I had to choose I just find over your headphones a lot more comfortable now thats not to say that me super bass is uncomfortable far from it theres ample padding on the band there is also good cushioning on the ear cups themselves one time I listen to music on this all morning and I didnt find it uncomfortable at all and its the 400 milli ampere battery inside that actually lets you go this long in the first place Xiaomi claims these can last up to 20 hours on a single charge but realistically expect about 14 to 15 hours at max volume now well that is impressive for a pair of cans that are this light for charging the me Super Bass does use of micro USB port I would have liked typec but again this price for an accessory Im not gonna complain no there is also an aux port here so if you do run out of charge you can always use these as a pair of regular wired headphones it doesnt need power to run it this way but when you use it with the aux cable these keys they do end up becoming useless you dont we get any use out of them on the flip side though you dont get any matin see either in your game we have Bluetooth there is a very slight latency if your gaming like with most Bluetooth headset so if youre serious about gaming you might be better off sticking to wired headsets but for the casual gamer there shouldnt be an issue now since I mentioned the buttons to the sides lets take a closer look at them there are three they arent very clicky and finding them pressing them it takes a little getting used to first the volume up and down Keys when you long press them they SS track skip keys so you can skip forwards or backwards without having to pull your phone out which is a good little Pro I really love that this is one of my biggest pet peeves with the air dots the fact that you cant really skip tracks now you can still launch voice assistant that is also a functionality thats present here for that you just need to double press the power button also long pressing the power button lets you pair it turn on and off short press lets you attend or end calls or pause and click its all pretty easy to figure out its quite intuitive so all thats great you know but these are headphones so lets talk about how they sound these headphones have 40 millimeter drivers and they sound really good they are well as the name indicates quite busy but even when listening to music thats not bass heavy they sounded good to me like Ive said in many videos in the past Im not an audiophile nor do I claim to be one where as a common consumer I like the sound signature of the me super bass the output was clean the vocals were clear the bass was good and thanks to Bluetooth 50 the range was pretty good  I didnt once experience any drop in connectivity in all the time that I used it and that said there is no multi device connectivity option either and that is a bit of a con here now as far as calling goes given I had a problem with that with the red knee air dots Im happy to say that I didnt experience any such issues your xiaomi has a microphone located on the right ear cup and it works reasonably well at most times I was able to take calls with these headphones on of course they dont sound as good as headphones with dedicated noise cancellation but calls were more or less fine as long as there wasnt a lot of onion noise talking about noise cancellation this one doesnt have it but given how loud it gets youre hardly gonna hear whats happening on the outside while using these it is worth pointing out that the on your design does lead to some sound leakage and people around you can hear what youre listening to so yeah thats always there so anyway in conclusion with the me super bass wireless headphones Xiaomi has again put together another amazing value for money proposition at thousand eight hundred rupees it can be an impulse buy for a lot of potential buyers and if you do end up buying this one Im sure youre not gonna regret it these are a good pair of wireless headphones for the price so thats my take now

headphones thats not by an accident theres no doubt that Bose has set the tone for noise cancelling headphones leading the industry and creating the technology about 30 years ago but these no headphones from sennheiser have a lot going for them theyre light theyre extremely portable theyre wireless and they have some cool tricks up their sleeve too right out of the case you can see theres a buttondown design look here thats very different from the sennheiser momentum 20 also a wireless noise cancer these are almost businesslike but they feel very nice theres a nice rubberized material here as I said theyre quite light and they also have some very nice padding inside and some luxurious leather on the outside of the pads as well which is pretty comfy on the right ear cuff you can see theres some very basic controls theres the noise canceling switch here that goes from off to light and heavy and then theres a little DSP mode button here that cycles through some different effects youve got off of course which is the default and then theres Club which gives you a little bit more bass theres movie which gives even more bass and then theyre speech which actually brings the midrange up a little bit thats used for phone calls now at the bottom you can see just the microUSB power input for charging them up have about 30 hours when youre plugged in or 20 hours without your Wireless and then theres a two point five millimeter input here for the very basic cable that comes with the headphones at the top here theres a little bluetooth switch but thats it four buttons on board as you can see theres no pairing or power key and thats because the PXE 550 actually turn on automatically and auto paired earphone they turn on as soon as you lock them in place when theyre laid flat like this the power is off and then when you lock them in place you hear a little british assistant that tells you they are powered off and theyre ready to go theyll remember up to two devices and theyll auto pair also on the right ear cup theres this little touch pad here that allows you to control playback you can tap it for play pause you can swipe it forward and backwards for switching songs and up and down for volume one interesting thing about these headphones is the volume works no matter what device youre connected to and it works even if youre plugged in its independent of your device and when it comes to noise canceling these are actually the best weve heard yet from Sennheiser they do a really good job with omnia noise of course no noise cancel a care of everything but even pin it against the Bose they do a good job I will say the ladies from Bose is a little bit better but its pretty close more importantly for us anyway is that the Sennheiser outperformed the latest from Bose when it comes to music playback sound is more dimensional its richer the bass is more musical and the midrange is smoother very well detailed its not quite as textural and dimensional as youll get from the momentum 20 but those do cost an extra 100 theres also a lighter tone color here which adds a bit more sparkle and presents to dialogue at 400 the pxc 550 are definitely a real investment and theyre about 50 more than boses Wireless QC 35 but with excellent noise cancelling the best weve heard from Sennheiser and fantastic audio performance these

the slightly cheaper rif wireless headset  for the purpose of this video so a big thanks to Skullcandy now both of these headsets are made of a hard plastic material the build quality is good and something I like about Skullcandy headsets are their designs and their choice of colors Ive been switching between both of these headsets for about 4 weeks and thats given me time to use them for a whole range of different things and now of course Im able to explain in this video exactly what I think about both of them they do both have easytouse controls on the right hand speaker and they both have a mic built in and the mic quality on both of these headsets is good Ive made quite a lot of phone calls using them and a few people have commented on how clear my voice sounds so to start with the slightly more expensive Heche 3 headset comes with a small user guide a microUSB cable for charging and also a cable with a 35 mm jack plug at both ends which means if this headset runs out of battery power you can still use it which really is grey the Rif wireless headset comes with a micro USB cable and a small instruction guide this one doesnt have a 35 millet and so there are no other cables included Skullcandy say the Heche 3 headset has up to 8 22 hour battery life but I havent quite managed to get that much out of it and for me its been more like 18 or 19 hours but I have been using it a lot and at higher volumes  it also features rapid charging which is awesome and a 10 minute charge gives you about 4 hours of playback time which is very handy the Rif wireless headset has a much lower battery life of 12 hours and although Im sure I didnt get a full 12 hours from each full charge it wasnt that far off the good news is though that this headset also has that rapid charge feature and a 10 minute charge will give you around 2 hours of playback time while thats not as impressive as the Hesh 3 headset I think is still very acceptable putting all of those features aside though what Im really interested in is the sound quality and while both headsets sound very different the audio quality is very good the Hesh trees are over ear headphones and Skullcandy say they have a noise isolation fit which is true as your ears sit in the sight the padding on both sides they dont have active noise cancellation but the ear cups which are very comfortable sit perfectly around my ears and because of that they do block out a lot of background noise in my opinion they do produce a good amount of bass I wouldnt say its incredible but I think as long as youre not looking for a seriously heavy amount of bass you would be happy with them also the midrange is good and the highs are clean too overall I think they produce a nice clean sound and everything Ive listened to Ive been really happy with theyre also fully adjustable to suit different sized heads and the padding for the top of your head is also reasonably thick which is great the Rif wireless headset is smaller and cheaper and the speakers sit on the outside of your ears and there isnt any padding on the band at the top but the speakers are very well padded again and with this headset the material thats touching your ears is very soft which means I actually found these slightly more comfortable to wear for a much longer period of time compared with the Heche 3 headset as the speakers sit on the outside of your ears you dont get that noise isolation and there is definitely a more open and airy feel when youre using them theres also less bass compared with the Hesh trees with that said though you do still get a very nice clean wellrounded sound which to me would be suitable for a bit of casual listening to music or even watching videos Ive had both headsets connected to my PC and Mac and Ive used them for things like video editing and watching YouTube as well and Ive been very happy with both of them Ive also had them connected to my phone and the sound quality is good there too theres little to no latency at all and I havent heard any distortion either at higher volumes even with some tracks that are very bass heavy both headsets paired up easily with my phone and the rubber covered buttons on the right hand side of both headsets give you playback and volume controls and you can of course activate the assistant on your phone such as Siri or Google assistant theyre both very flexible and they feel well built which makes me think they will last and they both offer slightly different features but they do of course both have slightly different prices there are lots of different colors and designs and if youd like to know more about either of these headsets Ill leave a link in the description below so do go and check them out personally Id go for the more expensive Heche 3 headset as that extra battery life is very useful the sound quality in my opinion is just simply better and I like having that 35 mm headphone jack  I think the Rif wireless headset is slightly expensive for what it is but with that said it is a nice headset I hope you enjoyed the video guys and as always if you did please give the video a thumbs up and let me know in the comments

"video_id": "velEAfLfkGs", "Closed Captions": " Music wireless technology used to be something that inspired on people something exciting and new nowadays its pretty mundane thats what happens when an invention becomes mainstream and dont get us wrong were not complaining wireless technologies help make our lives convenient to a degree that would otherwise be unimaginable but its easy to forget that this is what wireless technology is all about convenience its not a direct improvement over wires it just takes a different approach one that also has some downsides of its own with that in mind today well be taking a look at how wired and wireless gaming headsets measure up against each other by the end of this video we hope that youll know exactly which type is best suited to your gaming needs so without any further ado lets begin the first thing wed like to point out is that not all wireless headsets use the same wireless technology with modern wireless headsets youre presented with two options here they can either utilize Bluetooth or 24 gigahertz radio signals the benefits of Bluetooth are the lower price and the support for any Bluetooth enabled device this however comes at the cost of lower sound quality and shorter range the 24 gigahertz wireless is essentially the complete opposite headsets using this wireless technology have a better sound quality and a longer range but they suffer from a limited compatibility and the need to connect via their own wireless dongles in practice this means that Bluetooth headsets are a better pick if you intend to use them with multiple devices so while the sound quality will be lower by comparison we have to note that newer versions of Bluetooth offer a much better sound quality than older ones dead still worse in comparison to 24 gigahertz but still pretty good on the other hand if you plan on using the headset exclusively on your PC then choosing 24 gigahertz Wireless will give you the best sound quality just remember that whatever device youre planning to use these headsets on will need to have a USB port for the dongle and also support the headset in question now with that out of the way lets get back to the question of wired versus wireless headsets essentially there are three things to keep in mind when deciding which headset is the better pic for you these are the sound quality the price and whether you rather deal with the cable or the battery life lets start with the sound quality now before we go any deeper into this matter we have to remember that the sound quality depends on more than just the connection type the quality of the drivers plays the most crucial role here so 300 wireless headset will sound better than 100 wired one even despite the fact that poundforpound wired connections have the edge here another notion that wed like to dispel is that of sound quality being measured by bit rates wired connections support much higher bit rates than wireless connections thats true but the thing is these higher bit rates are in most cases unnecessary this is because digital audio rarely reaches bit rates that arent supported by quality wireless headsets now dont get us wrong its not that bit rates dont matter at all if youre listening to topquality lossless audio or analog records such as vinyl then yes youll need the higher bit rates and therefore a wired connection but were here to see which of these is better for gaming and frankly you have to be a certified audiophile to notice any difference here when it comes to ingame audio and mp3 files so there really is no concern not opt for a wireless headset at least as far as sound quality is concerned of course there are always other things to consider the first of which is usually the price wireless headsets may not sound discernibly worse for gaming but they sure are discernibly more expensive so the question here shifts from which one of these is better to why should I pay more for lower sound quality if youre on a budget the answer is you shouldnt especially if youre a PC gamer youll be next to your computer anyway when gaming so the only benefit of going Wireless would be to have one fewer cable to worry about getting tangled up doesnt seem like the best rate if your console gamer however then youll be sure to appreciate the added freedom of movement but this is already getting into the territory over third subcategory so lets roll the transition screen first okay thats better now what this section basically boils down to is both of these types of headsets have some drawbacks wired headsets can be a real hassle to manage what with the cables tangling in the limited range of movement but at least you dont have to worry about the battery getting out in the middle of a match and wireless headphones for all the freedom of movement they provide are still shackled by their battery life and ironically depend on cables for charging the battery life will depend on the model and how frequently and intensely theyre being used but most headset will need to recharge every couple of days or even daily in the end its entirely up to you to decide which of these is the lesser evil so when we look at all the equations what does the mat tell us is it better to use a wired or a wireless headset for gaming honestly neither is superior and it all comes down to preference but if we have to speak in general terms wired headsets are the better pick for PC gaming if nothing else theyre much more cost efficient however if youre a console gamer or used both platforms then going Wireless is definitely the wiser move of course another good question to ask yourself is whether you need a headset in the first place if headphones will suffice if you want to know more about the distinction between these two then check out the link in the description that will lead you to our video which covers this exact topic there will also be a link to the video where we list out the best wireless gaming headsets currently on the market so make sure you check that out as well if you decide going Wireless is the way to go and there you have it a brief video answering the ageold

this they then followed it up later with the red meat air dots as well as the chamois me air dots Pro and the me air dots Pro was shammies take on a smarter pair of true wireless headphones to compete with products such as the Apple earpods and this is Jimmys fourth attempt at giving us a pair of true wireless headphones in the shell meet me air to headphones and today were going to unbox it go over kind of the first impressions of it and then I want you guys to go ahead and leave me at your comments about what you guys want to know about them in the upcoming videos down below here with the box we have a box that is very reminiscent and very similar to what we had on the previous me arrow dots same color scheme everything on the back we do see now that theres a QR code for the Xiao AI as well as an app that would go along with it we do have the LH DC which is the low latency high definition audio in regards to the specs on the back we have USB typec we have four hours of battery life with with the headphones no charging case with the charging case we are looking at 14 hours of playback in regards to the driver size it looks like its a five millimeter driver and lets just kind of get into this now I was able to purchase these from a local retailer here in Hanoi and if you guys are looking to go ahead and pick these up I will try to find them and use them in the affiliate links down below it goes a long way to supporting my channel and if you guys want to go ahead and reach out to me Twitter is the best place to do so just shoot me a tweet and at me so I can get the notification for it and if you guys want to check out pictures Im gonna be posting some pictures for this on shamit ography as well as having a full writeup on my website now here we are in decay we have the box we have an identical charging cable to what we had with the me arrow dots Pro which are these are the me air one headphones we have some literature for them and that appears to be it theres obviously no gel ear tips in these the preliminary thing that were greeted with is this charging case in regards to how the charging case its a little bright and whereas how this charging case compares with the case of the regular meteor dots it is definitely smaller its a little bit bigger still than the case of the Apple earpods but for you guys to see a comparison here we go we have the charging port on the bottom this is a very Apple esque wrapping of these headphones okay now in hand feel immediately I gotta say guys immediate first impressions on comparing these two cases the case of the me err dots err  feels cheaper than the case of the regular meet err dots the the hinge mechanism and the plastic just doesnt seem as nice as it is on here now we do know that they did it go ahead and give us a better chip set in these new headphones and we know that theres going to be updated controls but still I dont like that now when we get the actual headphones themselves okay this is a thick boy this is a thick thick boy we have headphone connectors in a similar style to what we have on the regular me err dots and we have a microphone here on the bottom the the kind of the plastic that these are made out of guys to be completely honest with you it feels cheaper and lower quality than it does on the originals and I know a lot of people are gonna be angry at me for saying that okay now Im running me y11 and we are supposed to have a new animation to go along with this new pair of headphones and lets go ahead and disconnect this from my current pair available devices me err  now this is for the case guys and this is kind of strange settings I dont know if this is a shammy EU thing that we dont have but right now I cannot change anything that we have here I cant change these for a different audio codec which is a little disappointing lets see if I can do that in the developer settings Bluetooth audio codec lets see if thats saved or not nope we are back to AAC audio obviously some bugs still with these guys to be honest with you a little disappointing but lets go ahead lets put these in Im trying to connect and use these guys but right now Im on me why 11 beta I should I should be getting decent functionality out of these and its totally possible that we we have you know features that are going to be coming in later versions of me UI but right now so we do have autoplay pause lets listen to some music guys I have visit almost full volume and I because theres no sound isolation Im not that impressed lets check the latency on AAC okay the latency on these guys is actually pretty good obviously were gonna be having a full review coming soon but this was just kind of the first kind of impressions that we had on this honestly guys Im not super impressed with these right off the rep but overall I think that it is I think that it is a decent attempt at going after Apple earpods I need to see better integration or I need to see a companion app I need to see something that is going to convince me that these are are better in any way whatsoever than these and obviously we are going to be comparing these verses these in in the next coming days so subscribe let me know what you guys want to see in the comment section down below and until next time its been Mitchell coming to you guys from Hanoi peace", "video_title": "Xiaomi Mi Air 2 Mi

wireless headphones now these are actually a four and a half star out of five rating on Amazon right now and theyre Amazon choice so apparently a lot of people are like them now these have dual 40 millimeter drivers theyre saying that it has truetolife audio and rich bass now these dont have active noise cancellation but they say that it has passive noise reduction Im not really sure who to believe or what to believe but on on the box it says music play time up to 24 hours and charging time is about three hours but on their Amazon page theyre saying four hours of charge gets you 40 hours of play time so I dont know who to believe what a the way this is open this up wow those have some weight to them alright so weve got a warranty card 30 day money back guarantee 18 month replacement warranty and lifetime support guarantee so thats pretty good instruction manual and some cables we got a 35 to 35 cable and a very small USB to micro USB cable ooh ooh those actually feel very premium Wow it snaps into place crack now the cushion on here feels very soft and very very cushiony man thats nice Im diggin that the top part its got the same same cushion on it just a little thinner you got your nice Illuma it looks like brushed aluminum just saying that its a metallic slider Im not sure what that means but it looks like brushed aluminum on the left side you got the 35 milimeter port on the right side youve got your micro USB port and you have your volume controls right here and your power right here ooh very nice Im diggin the look of them definitely nice and cushy alright lets turn it on LED indicators on the bottom of the right one so there is a try bit extra tune head I like the accent on there okay cool so I got to turn it down its got some volume its very thumpy dance music boys wow thats got some volume I dont know if you guys can hear that bass but that is some very rumbling bass thats pretty good I like that fruit or sugar ASIS all right Im gonna do a distance check its a Bluetooth 41 so hopefully well get about 30 feet or so all right Ill be back all right okay so I got about 36 ish feet with a couple walls actually in between and then it finally cut out so distance is actually pretty good lets try the back pocket no skipping all right lets make a phone call hello hey I always said I sound really loud so the microphone is is so good that you can actually hear the echo in the room okay how about can you hear this oh okay so the microphone is really good that might not be good if youre out in public and stuff okay all right thanks Beth all right well thats different so the microphone on here I dont know where the microphone even is we doesnt the microphone is like right there but she said that its so good that she can hear the echo in the room but not only that she can also hear like ambient noise so that might not be good if youre trying to talk on the phone and youre in a public place or in a loud area but man these things are these things are great these are actually pretty good I can see why its got a four and a half star rating theyre very comfortable the build quality on these are actually pretty pretty good I mean for 50 bucks they kind of feel a little more expensive than that really highs mids and lows on a scale of one to ten five being what I would expect I didnt actually expect them to sound that feeling Ill give a seven and a half for highs and mids because I think they could be a little more clear the bass Im gonna give like an eight and it is a very rich bass its not the most powerful bass the bass isnt the most dominant thing here I feel like these headphones are pretty well equalized they did a pretty good with them over all this to how they sound great theyre super comfortable the only downside I guess is that the microphone may be a little too powerful and they look pretty good Im digging the look oh and of course theyre super convenient to fold up throw in a bag or something if 50 bucks is in your range of wireless headphones this is not a bad place to start looking anyway guys that is it Im gonna leave a link down the description below as usual I leave it in your hands but

your mind is excellent quality well these are premium segment budget headphones from Sony and theyre currently priced at 8990 in this video were gonna do an unboxing and have a quick overview of the device so continue watching this video this is your friend tech saying lets get started Music so here they are the sony xba1 hundreds first in on the box is extra bass written in bold then you have 30 hours battery life Bluetooth wireless Bluetooth Google assistant and Alex are built in these are black color they are also available in a blue color there is extra bass written on the other side alright on the back you can see it says overwhelming deep bass and clear vocals handsfree calling with HD voice 10 minute charge plays up to 90 minutes music playback time battery life is maximum 30 hours voice assistant function compatible with Android app Ansari it has USB C that is great and a headphone cable which you can connect to listen to a source when the battery runs out and there is something called as D s EE which is digital sound enhancement engine I will be talking about this in my full review but just to give you the basics it helps you improve the audio quality and NFC is also on board so NFC is there so that means you can now pair it with any Android phone with NFC with just tapping it on the back so thats great right lets quickly unbox this Wow box packing is really impressive there you go and they look amazing just the first look and you know its premium so it says easy setup download the app you can scan the QR code from here download the app you will get the app on the Apple App Store as well as on any Android Google Play Store power on your headphones and connected via the app inside the box theres some paperwork and some installation guide a 35 mm  35 M cable to connect to your headphones when the battery on these totally runs out there is also a charging cable which is now a USB C to USB and then the X B 700 headphones lets have a closer look at them oh god they look absolutely gorgeous the made out of polycarbonate and they look extremely premium here on the right ear cup you can even see an NFC logo which means the NFC chip is here so you can use your Android NFC devices to just keep it here pair it and itll start working instantaneously you have the Sony branding on the top and its got this lovely beautiful matte finish its engraved it looks beautiful Wow the cushions on the top are really wonderful theres Sony branding on both the sides and the cushions on the cups are too good cant wait to wear them theyre like extremely soft I can imagine that when theyre providing 30 hours of battery life the cushions have to be good so that you can wear it for longer so lets see the buttons so on the left here cup you have a custom button right on the top now what is custom button so this from the app you can change it to either Alexa  Google home or  Siri so you can choose either of the three from the app so when you press this it will directly enable that heres the power pairing button heres the USB C port to charge the device heres a 35 mm audio headphone to connect to when the juice on this totally runs out and this seems to be a mic or an LED light will no but I think this is a mic and on the other side which is the other Cup you have a plusminus tactile buttons and the center button definitely is to play and pause the plus will also be to change the track you press and hold it changes the next track you press and hold it goes to the previous track trust me I love the build quality and its not too heavy under 200 grams 195 grams to be exact so lets turn this on pair it with the phone and see how it performs pairing the headphones with your phone is simple standard procedure hold the power button for five seconds and it will show up in the Bluetooth settings once that is done go to the Sony headphone app and finish the setup by following the steps all right here it is WH xB 700 W it stands for wireless headphones by the way and its at 100 here is the surround which you can change directly from your arena club outdoor stage concert hall or turn it off so you have a full surround effect available here you have clear base which you can reduce or increase so if some feel that the bass is too much you can reduce it if you want more you can increase it from here great sound position control so this is from which direction you feel the sound is coming from it will give you create that sound positioning effect so right now its front right its from the front its from the front left rear left rear right and off thats actually a good option now playing so suppose youre playing songs from Apple music or streaming from YouTube or just any music streaming app or even if songs are on this it will show up here whatever Springs you can control stop next volume everything from this app directly as well some quality mode since sound quality mode you have your priority on sound quality and priority on stable connection now suppose you are in a crowded train or youre traveling to work or if you are sitting in an office where your phone is a little further away from you and you feel that a connection isnt that strong enough you can go to priority on stable connection okay D s WDS EE stands for a digital sound enhancement engine by default its turned off you can turn it on and becomes Auto so it will help improve your sound quality alot but it will also decrease your battery life so by default it is set to OFF you can decide when youre listening to it whether you like to keep it off so that there is a little less of loss of sound quality when you turn this on change function of custom buttons so theres a custom button on the headphone which you can custom decide what you want it for you can choose it for voice assistant function like now if its selected voice assistant function and if I press that button it will enable Siri you can choose it to launch Google assistant or Amazon Alexa you can just custom choose it from here there are not many more options apart from these three custom means just the three of these not anything apart from these so its a nice comprehensive app you can set up things from here you can directly set things also a very important point these headphones will get software updates wire this app which is great usually when its with our phones we go with software updates and we wait for updates right here when you get an update it will show up on the top that there is an update available wonderful that these headphones can be updated via this app this app is going to be really helpful well now its time to wear this and see how comfortable and hows the sound quality the cushions on the headphones are extremely comfortable the headband is also well cushioned and soft these are all the ear headphones the cups are completely covering the ears creating a good seal but you can hear some ambient noises the buttons on the cups are tactile the fit and comfort of these headphones are excellent alright enough said time to listen to some music Music okay first thing deep is absolutely stellar the instrument separation is clear as crystal the XV 700 is perfectly tuned for the Indian audience the youth will love it there really shine when you feed it some bass absolutely brilliant value for money wow what an experience it was in my short time of using it the sound quality is absolutely ear pleasing its lightweight they look premium yes they dont have noise cancelling but theyre still so much more that is already there its wonderful the bass is excellent if you want to buy one and leave the links in the description you should check them out they absolutely worth the price also Ill be doing an indepth review where Ill be covering more of its features in depth more about the sound quality and battery life as and when I use it so you dont want to miss the full review video that will be coming very soon so I hope this video was helpful right on in the comments and give me our feedback about this video also if there are any other video ideas or questions about the Sony headphones Ill be happy to help dont

Thompson wireless headphones now I bought these mostly for listening to TV late at night give me a quick look over the unit on the base cradle part here we have power input and theres two combo sight plugs on here is two selector switch for the channels and on the base you have some foam pads you get an adapter for 63 millimeter from threeandahalf millimeter and I have this at the minute its plugged into mp3 player theres the cable which comes out the back so thats your sound source onto the headphones one side is marked bat at the top pull that off and you have your two rechargeable triplea batteries that are in the box just pop them in and thats ready to charge and clip that back on controls very straightforward and you have the power button here you will see a port here where theres two metal contacts thats when you charge the headphones and theres an autotuned button here on this side now theres a volume control here too so to charge the phones make sure that off and then pop them in and you will see the light turn to green now Ive been testing these out Im just streaming the music now first thing to note was you need to have the source volume up a bit otherwise it will be a bit quiet for you once thats done and you have a good source the sound quality was quite good not particularly heavy on the bass but quite acceptable for the price range and the phones were quite lightweight and comfortable didnt have any problems with the range either I walked all around the house had the base unit here and it picked it up perfectly throughout the entire house so the signal is actually very good on this overall for a lightweight reasonably costeffective set of headphones wireless these are pretty good if youre looking for something thats a bit more heavy on the base and you like a bit more thump to a sound then you might want to look at something that suits that need a bit better but overall pretty good set of headphones", "video_title": "Thomson WHP3001BK

Thomson Wireless headphones Thomson are a brand owned by Hama\n\nThis came in quite a large box included were\nThe headphones\nPlastic standbase for charging and connecting to the audio output\nPower adapter\n35mm to 63mm chrome plated adapter this allows you to use larger headphone sockets\n2 x AAA NiMH rechargeable batteries rated at 550mAh\nA lead with a 35mm male plug to 2 x composite plugs you connect this to the base and then to the sound source length 110cm approx\n\nThe user guide is quite clear the phones are easy to set up pop off the right side of the phones insert the AAA cells plug in the charger and set the phones down in the cradle there are 2 holes on the right side and 2 prongs on the cradle for charging The manual recommends a 24 hour initial charge To set up the audio attach the 2 composite leads the whitered sockets and plug in the stereo plug to the sound source TV stereo MP3 player etc On th right is a power button the left ear pad has the auto tune button You can change the frequency channel on the back of the charging stand via a switch to 3 positions if you need to\n\nIn use\n\nRange was good on the phones I had no problems using them in various rooms and a good distance away from the base station the manual quotes about 20 metres inside and its not far off of that in my testing I didnt have any interference issues or dropping out of sound Exact range might vary concrete wallsfloors will reduce it a bit no complaints here To adjust the volume use the dial on the left hand side\n\nFit was good quite comfortable on the head the top band has some padding to it and the phones are light to wear Deep padding on the ear pads nice to see that\n\nThe main base will light up red via an LED when its connected to a sound source and powered on A green LED lights up when you have the phones in the base charging you have to power off the phones it takes about 10 hours to fully charge them and I got about 7 hours continuous use off one charge lowest volume levels will give slightly longer endurance The base is a bit hollowthin plastics wise nothing mind blowing here it does the job no more In most cases I found the charging worked fine but you might need to move the position of the phones to engage the pins\n\nSound quality\n\nAt this price level the phones sound fairly good but with an emphasis on the mid tones speech and vocals bass is a bit weak I expected more in this area they dont have a lot of depth or punch in the lowest frequencies though an acceptable response for the upper bass level Treble was clear enough without being too sharp To get a decent output make sure the volume of the source ie TV or Hifi is up higher then adjust the headset level as required\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nFor the asking price these headphones are pretty good easy to set up and have a stable reliable connection The sound is respectable though I feel they work better for TV listening than music If you like a deep tight bass thump youll be disappointed in these headphones the upper low end is quite good but they dont have huge depth in the bass its quite laid back and relaxed Saying that they were satisfactory for music listening if youre not overly fussy or dont compare them to some wired phones which will do better here", "video_like_count": "1230", "video_thumbnail": "httpsiytimgcomviVD6UX3PIz1Ahqdefaultjpg"}

again with yet another jaybird x4 video today were gonna compare them to the Bose sound sport Wireless so weve already received a few emails from people asking hey should I get Bose or should I get Jaybirds so thats what were gonna cover in todays video were gonna cover the major reasons you would get jaybird  pose and Bose  jaybird of course we did do individual reviews of them and Ill link those down below in the description if you enjoy the video make sure to give us a thumbs up and if you want to see more videos like this and be a part of what we got going on here make sure to subscribe that is if youre new if youre not new make sure to unsubscribe then resupplied then unsubscribe then reese absque ribe then watch this video three times share it on Facebook or Twitter lets get to it Applause all right so lets start with the jaybird x4 because as you will soon see they beat the living heck out of the bows sounds far wireless so the first thing is price the jaybird x4 is have an MSRP of 130 dollars whereas the bows are about 150 dollars now Ill link both in the description so you can see the current pricing or you can head on over to our website Rizzos calm or say it with me download a completely free iOS and Android mobile app where we source some of the best deals on the Internet and we could save you guys a heck of a lot of money but anyways I brought this up because the x4 is just on paper our more affordable so if youre choosing purely based on price youre gonna go with the xforce the second thing is sound isolation so they go completely into ear canal and they see a lot off entirely which means you can focus on your workout and you dont hear a lot of the things around you now thats a little bit of a doubleedged sword so Ill cover that in the bow section but if you want sound isolation youre going to get the X force number 3 they have a customizable EQ function so if you jump into the jbird app you can adjust the entire EQ settings for the x 4s bass mids highs however you like or you can select presets based on the genre of music youre listening to now beause they have an auto EQ future now beause they have an auto EQ future holy I cannot say 8u you cute look the point is that with the J vertex fours you can customize it however you like and with Bose they have an auto feature that kind of plays with the EQ to make the sound as best as possible but I personally like the option of being able to manually adjust that EQ function within the jbird app they also have a find my buzz feature also in there and just based on battery life to the X fours have battery life of about eight to nine hours on a single charge whereas Bose is about six hours and they are way bigger earbuds and then they have a battery life of about six hours on a single charge now the X fours also have a quick charge feature you charge them for like 10 minutes that gets you an entire hours worth of playback time I mean the wind definitely goes to the X for is on everything battery life next is the one Im calling sport fit so the X fours are sleeker theyre smaller they have more wearable methods and they come with more ear tips so not only silicon ear tips but also foam ones as well so you can wear them under ear which is kind of like the most popular way you wear them down and back around your head or you can wear them around your ears and string that cord up against the back of your neck so I think just the fit for working out the size of the earbuds all the different fit options gives a major edge to the X force I mean the bow sound sport Wireless theyre so big that they were just constantly pissed me off when I do box jumps or Sprints or go running cuz they would bounce up and down theyre so heavy so the sport fit advantage definitely goes to X fours and the last thing is waterproofing the X fours are water resistant down to one meter for 30 minutes whereas the bosons bar wireless or ipx4 certified which means yeah you can run in the rain or sweat all over them but you cant submerge them I guess thats not really that big of a deal but just on paper the X fours have better waterproofing so I think most people you should get the X force like I said Ill link them in the description I think most people will find them comfortable youll like them youll like the audio quality youll like the Bluetooth connection youll like everything I talked about but there are some people that will prefer the Bose sound sport Wireless and there are at least a few advantages with those the first is kind of the flip side of the sound isolation so if youre running in an urban area and you want to be able to hear the surroundings around you you need to be able to let in some of that sound if you have too good of sound isolation you wont let in any of that sound so with the Bose because they dont completely seal off your ear canal you will get some of that ambient noise in so theres some people that will like that the second thing is and this is so disappointing Im really grasping at straws at this point is that they charge via microUSB the jaybird X fours they use a proprietary cable and the Bose they use a micro USB cable which is easier for travel if you you know you dont have to bring a second different type of you know charge cable you just get a standard microUSB cable I know thats not that big of a deal so thats it I mean let me know what you think write me in comments do you actually think that theres a reason to get the bows over the Jaybirds I I I cant see it let me know Ill see you guys next time

today I want to talk about watching TV more specifically watching TV with headphones now this is something I do quite a lot because I get quite a busy household its quite loud and sometimes I just want to listen to the TV uninterrupted so what Ive always done is used one of these yeah its a cable but more specifically its a cable that plugs into my evm I have an AVM which I used to watch TV movies thats how I get my sound so if I want to plug in earphones to it I need one of these it converts it into a 35 millimeter jack so what I would do is I would take this plug it into my headphones and then Id plug it into my arm now if I was lucky there this flakes would be long enough for me to watch TV while Im sitting on the couch unfortunately it wasnt so I had to buy this which is an extender cord yeah so you take this out here youd plug the extender cord into here and then as you can see weve got lots of chords here can get a bit messy and then they plug that enter there and they were have it I can no listen to the TV my headphones unfortunately Ive got all this cable and what happens is the kids come along trip over it and I cant listen to anything so what I really wanted to do was make use of these Wireless head this is what Ive always wanted set in a coach no wires so when I was asked to review vests I jumped at the chance so why is it well its a Bluetooth transmitter receiver so it converts my TV equipment which doesnt have bluetooth into bluetooth so I can use these so lets get into the video so Music heres the box for the Bluetooth yangu transmitter receiver nothing from really to see on the front its just a plain box now in the back of the box it shows you the two modes and they receive Mort though that is for when youre using your tablet or your phone to effectively cast your music on to know your hifi equipment that doesnt normally have Bluetooth enabled the transmit mode that is where youre using your headphones which is what Im gonna be showing in this video to basically watch TV and listen to TV using your headphones that is the transmit mode now this particular model is more available and then Yuki and Amazon but there are other models very similar to that and Im gonna put links to that for the US market from amazoncom and weightwise it comes at 150 grams so its really really late ok so the technical parameters right the battery standard is a six hundred milli amp the working hours is 20 hours and it charges and roughly about three hours and the charging voltage is 5 volts and it does run off Bluetooth 50 so would you get in the box well you do get an instructional guide which says does come in really handy you do need that you get some micro USB that it charges with and you get all the leads that you need for audio so youve got your regular audio leads youve got 35 millimeter jack 2 35 millimeter jack and you also have got an optical cable provided now if you just have a little look at the device what were looking at here is youve got your optical in optical out and to the left of that thats where you charge that actually put your microUSB and to the right and thats where you put your 35 millimeter jack as you can see it is written on the bottom when you to learn that its the actual bottom of the device now if it just look trying to say though this is where weve got a couple of options here weve got excellent weve got a speed diff and weve also got our X and T X doesnt really mean much rate note but it will mean more to you once we get into the video that has important those little buttons there right so this is my amp and were gonna set it up now just ignore the mess for the Xbox and all the cables right so thats what we showed you earlier Im just plugging into the headphone socket and then Im just putting in 35 millimeter to 35 millimeter cable one goes into the arm other goes into the device right and they will just give that a little tidy there hopefully itll balance on top of there and you have probably one but just ignore the cables I would normally hate that behind the amp anyway right so lets have a look at the instructions to peer you say your Bluetooth enabled devices like bluetooth headphones or speakers into pairing mode right so thats fairly straightforward normally you just do a long press and one of the buttons on your headphones or it may even do it automatically it depends on your device right then you st the b19 to TX mode okay that seems fairly straightforward then you power on then you tap the MF button twice to interfering wood with the LED indicator keep rapidly flashing blue okay thats fairly straightforward thats weve done that now now just have to set the headphones into peeling wood and these headphones is just a long press and there we go thats it in peeling would know and then we just leave them together for about 20 to 30 seconds for them to peer up right so this point where I had a little snag because it just kept blinking away for longer than the 10 between seconds then I looked instructions again and then it said something about switching between spdif mordar SP death mode an axillary mode and it worked as you can see it thats it so one long flash of blue means they are completely paired up so I can basically set my couch and watch the TV and peace and then may be popped into being cue and get some wallpaper finish off the decorating and if youre interested to know how to put into receiving mode so that as when you would use your tablet or your phone and its effectively casting music on to your hifi or stereo equipment then you set it to rx mode instead of TX mode and then pretty much do the exact same thing the other thing that you may have to encounter is enable the Bluetooth function on your device you have to find the BT b19 to connect and then possibly having to put in the pin of zero zero zero zero right so there you go not bad little device there and its very very simple and straightforward to connect up and you can also if you like use it for evey equipment and for example to wirelessly play music from your iPhone or your iPod or your iPad or any tablet get rid of the eyes onto you to your TV speakers personally I dont use it myself because lets face it I can use that through your other devices but the option is there always if you need it so the quality of the sound is okey its not as good as if you use a direct feed but youd only listen to TV so the quality is very much good enough I will see one thing though you will get better quality with the bitter hit for that you use so the better wireless headphones youve got the better the quality of the audio from your TV or whatever ears you are listening to so there we go I hope you like that and thanks very much for watching I hope youre all well and Ill see the next one so I really wanted to do is make use of these wireless headphones this why is it well its a bluetooth receiver transceiver so what is it well its a Bluetooth

"video_id": "jnuRlrXjZP4", "Closed Captions": " hello guys Thunder hi and welcome back to a new video in which Im going to review these sony WH exmiss 700 headphones first of all let me explain this name Sony made these headphones WH stands for wireless headphones xB stands for extra bass and 700 is just the naming of this particular headphone in that extra bass series of headphones does this device provide extra bass we will talk about everything in this video first of all lets start with the very quality because build quality on this device is pretty flexible I mean good actually but the headphones are flexible you can do like this if your head is this big then its totally possible to use these headphones my mind isnt and I have not seen anyone with this big head in real life at least but when it comes to big already its entirely made out of plastic so it doesnt feel very premium to touch I mean when I touch the headphones it doesnt feel very premium leather type material is used at the top of the headphone and metal part is used inside this when if you want to stretch the earphones which this is the maximum then you can do that I would recommend you to use according to your size so that it will fit perfectly on you so when it comes to overall build quality it gets a huge thumbs up when it comes to built on yet such I dropped it multiple times and did nothing happen but when it comes to touching or looking at that once they do not look very premium or they do not feel like they are worth nine thousand rupees for seven to eight thousand rupees if they are on some type of deal lets talk about the ear cups now these ear cups have cushioning type of material but its not as soft as my signature HD 598 sv or even my son over headphones which I reviewed few days back on the channel these are on your headphones and not over ear headphones just in case we do not know the difference on your means these headphones will rest on the ear itself meaning they touch the year throughout your usage whereas over the year means they will not touch your ear and theyll cover your entire year as such I personally find over the year headphones to be very comfortable and I guess thats the case with majority of people and thats why after half an hour of usage you may feel like removing the xb7 and Dell to make sure that air goes through your ear or something like that you will feel better or maybe thats just me considering I am used to using over the ear headphones and not on your headphones is it bad not really because these are very tight and on ear headphones they give you very good noise isolation as well and specifically with the WH xB 700 the noise isolation is very good no active noise cancellation is present away yes still if you listen to the songs or movies at lets say 80 or 90 volume most of the noise which is present outdoors or around you will not be able to penetrate these headphones so thats another really nice thing about these headphones will these headphones provide extra bass if you are into that absolutely I personally like natural sound I mean little bit of bass is any day appreciate it from me but when I use these headphones there was little bit of extra bass and I did not hate it because it doesnt produce artificial based on the stock settings which is at zero I mean if you open the application and connect the headphone through that then you get an option to increase the level to seven and the artificial bass will be added at seven and dot it will be very busy at that particular time two or three i enjoyed using the headphones bass is very pronounced and clear this is a headphone made for bass its in my opinion if you need good amount of bass in a wireless headphones then these headphones are worth the money for about eight thousand rupees in my opinion what about other sound quality factors such as if youre listening to lecture some accosting song or some instrument notes sound pretty good as well just in case if you do not like the bass which these headphones produce then you can reduce the amount of bass as well lets say 2  3 or  both and then it will not produce the same amount of bass which it was producing earlier and then it will sound as if they are producing a natural sound I personally feel for me 0  2 or 3 is the best setting going to a negative setting usually did not produce the best sound result as compared to how it produced on 0 Im talking about the app which you are seeing on the screen right now overall sound quality as such I am going to give it 8 out of 10 if you are a base 8 if you love bass then nine point five out of 10 from my side when it comes to our jade sings sad song or something like that they sounded pretty good as well even though those sad songs there is an internal instrument like drum or something like that that adds a little bit of bass as well so it feels a little bit busy but I am I was ok with that because the base was of very good quality if you are traveling in and I wrote lengthen there are going to be a lot of people who are going to use bluetooth headphones and if use your experience some sort of drop or something like that you can select stable connection in the app and then the app will make sure that you get the most stable connection with your WH XD 700 headphones now this headphone comes with in bit Google assistant and Amazons Alexa notice that if you use Google assistant on this headphone you can reply to whatsapp you can reply to messages just by using your headphones these headphones come with USB typec support thanks only for adding that and not just USB typec fast charging Video Suite XE is possible these headphones also have a headphone jack I mean obviously but still I need to mention that 35 mm headphone jack to be precise if you love the wire which is provided in the box itself then you can use this and use the headphone jack which is present on the device if it is present on your device then very good good luck youve got a very good device and the normal functionality such as pausing the song cutting the call or exiting the call shifting to next song is totally possible with all these three buttons which are present on the headphones Im not going to talk about that you do not get a carrying case in the box but the headphone can rest like this when youre traveling and walking or running around with the headphones like this is totally possible I having fast charging with this Sony headphone means like 10 minutes of charge will give you 90 hours not 90 hours 90 minutes of playback but when it comes to overall battery life frankly speaking I was not able to get the battery of these headphones to 0 even once I used the headphones for an entire week without charging this is the first time I have got through this long with any type of boobs headphones or earphones and the headphone was still at only 50 I mean it was about 10 to 15 hours of listening time more towards like 15 hours of listening time and sony claims to have 30 hours of battery life which is very close I mean you can get 27 to 28 hours of battery life basically battery life is fantastic on the headphones so who should buy the sony xba1 in red personally if you love bass and you want bluetooth headphones then probably these are the only have that you can go with because they are very messy and they come with good connection notice that if you need great battery life in your headphone then these are the headphones to go for no doubt about that and I guess thats not it for this particular video if you enjoyed it give this to your thumbs up if you still have any more doubts and queries regarding this video do let me know about that in the comment section box below these headphones are available for about 8000 rupees when they are on sale they directly into buy these headphones will be present in the description box below as well so yeah thank you guys thank fortune", "video_title": "Extra BASS

from rtingscom and today we are going over the best wireless sports headphones that you can purchase so far in 2020 To help you stick to your new years resolutions weve compiled our recommendation list for the wireless best sports headphones based on these criteria The headset should be very portable and easy to carry around They should be stable comfortable breathable and sweat resistant enough for most exercises They should also sound good enough so that you enjoy your workout music and should be easy to use so that youre not fidgeting with controls instead of focusing on your workouts Lastly depending on your environment you may want something that isolates you from the noise around you or that lets you monitor your surroundings for traffic and potential obstacles say when running outdoors So with that being said here are our best sports headphone recommendations that you can purchase so far in 2020 Starting with the best budget options In the best budget category so if you want to spend less than 50 you have the option between the Upgraded Anker Soundbuds Curve or the SoundPeats TrueFree The 2019 upgraded soundbuds Curve is a great budget headset for sports Theyre compact inears portable enough to easily carry on you or in your gym bag and they come a good hard carrying case provided in the box Their ear hook design makes them stable enough for most exercises so they wont fall off your ears even when running on a treadmill or doing more demanding workout routines They also have a an ipx7 rating for water and sweat resistance although we do not have an inhouse test to confirm this Theyre easy to use thanks to their simple three button set up on their inline remote and theyre decently comfortable since their inear tips dont quite enter the ear canal as deeply as most inears designs They also have a surprisingly great battery life of 18 hours of play time on a single charge and a decently sound that packs a lot of bass to get you pumped when youre at the gym Unfortunately they do not have the best build quality Its decent for the price range and they should last you a while but the cable that connects the two earbuds is relatively thin and maybe the most susceptible part of their design They also do not have any customization options and arent quite as compact as some of the truly wireless options In that sense if you prefer a truly wireless design for sports but still want a budget option then consider the Soundpeats truefree instead They will easily fit in your pockets and theyre stable enough for most exercises Theyre also fairly comfortable despite their more traditional inear fit The earbuds are dense feel well made and sturdy for their budget price range and they deliver a satisfying sound profile that packs quite a bit of bass Also thanks to their more traditional inear fit they block more noise than the upgraded curve making them a bit more suitable for a crowded noisy gym Unfortunately they do not have the best controls which means you will have to pull out your phone a few times to adjust the volume Theyre also only iPX4 splash resistant so we dont expect them to be as sweatproof as the ankers Their sound quality will be a bit too bass centric for some and lastly they do not have the longest battery life at only 33 hours on a single charge On the upside you do get 45 additional charges in the case for a total of up to 15 hours and there is also a version with a case that has a bigger battery capacity If you like the truly wireless format and are willing to spend a bit more then the best options for sports you can get in this design are the Jaybird Vista Jabra Elite 75t and the Beats PowerBeats Pro The Jaybird Vista are a rugged and portable sports headphone especially thanks to their very compact charging case Theyre lightweight breathable and comfortable to wear for long workout sessions They are also quite stable in the ear once you get a good fit They have a decently long battery life on a single charge at 55 hours and their case gives about 10 extra hours so they should last long enough for most workout routines and for your trip to and from the gym Theyre also ipX7 water resistant and have a fairly wellbalanced sound out of the box that you can further customize with one of the best companion apps weve tested for any truly wireless earbud The app gives you access to fully parametric EQ so you can turn up the bass to get you pumped during your gym sessions and switch to a different profile when listening casually Unfortunately their control scheme isnt the best out of the box so you will have to use to app to configure the button layout so that you can have both volume and media controls on the buds They also look a little cheap for their price range but that will be a minor issue especially if youre looking for a rugged pair of sports headphones If youre looking for something a bit more versatile for everyday use that also works well at the gym then consider the Jabra Elite 75t instead The 75t is the latest update to the Jabra truly wireless elite line up which offers smaller earbuds that are more comfortable to wear than the previous models of the line up The 75t also last longer on a single charge and have up to 12 hours more of battery life in their charging case when compared the Elite and Elite active 65t The 75t have a good control scheme thats easy to use a decent sound profile which you can customize via their companion app and their inear fit blocks enough noise to be a decent option in moderately noisy environments The Elite Active 65t are a good alternative at a cheaper price point that blocks a bit more noise but for most they are not as comfortable or as stable as the 75t which may be a deciding factor Lastly if you prefer a prefer an earhook design that offers a more stable fit than the most truly wireless options on this list then get the Powerbeats pro The powerbeats pro do not have the customization options of the Jaybird or the Jabra Theyre also a bit more optimized for iOS users due to the H1 chip and their lightning charging cable They are also not as Sweat or water resistant as the other models However they provide one of the easiest to use control schemes weve tested so you will rarely have to interact your phone to skip rewind tracks or change the volume They also have one of the longest lasting battery life on a single charge for any truly wireless design at 114 hours with an additional charge in the case This make them one of the more practical truly wireless options for all day listening and they charge fairly fast for their long playback time The powerbeats pro also have a wellbalanced sound profile with a good amount of bass theyre comfortable to wear since their inear fit doesnt quite enter the ear canal as deeply as typical inear designs and the earbuds are decently portable Unfortunately their charging case not so much Its big bulky and bit plasticky for their price range They also feel a bit bland overall when compared to the other truly wireless options since they do not come with a proper app and cannot be customized to better match your listening preferences Now depending on your workout environment you may need a headset that lets you monitor your surroundings for potential traffic or incoming obstacles In that sense the best option weve tested so far are the AfterShokz Aeropex The Areopex are bone conducting headphones so they wont provide as good a listening experience for music as more typical inears and overears Also since they do not block your ear canal at all in noisy environments they will be harder to hear than most headphones On the upside they are a great improvement over the previous AfterShokz bone conducting headphone weve tested and in the right settings there is nothing quite like it for keeping your ear completely open so you can focus on your surroundings while still listening to a podcast or workout playlist This makes them a good choice for running outdoors and theyre have a stable around the head design thats decently comfortable They are also lightweight portable enough to keep on you at all times and flexible enough to fit into your pockets They have a good iP67 rating which makes them an excellent option for running and intense workouts Theyre easy to use and provide all necessary controls at your fingertips they also lasted about 12 hours in battery drain test which should be good enough for working out and all day listening although unlike some of the other options on this list you will have to charge them about once a day Unfortunately they come with a proprietary charging cable which is not the most practical for everyday use On the upside it does help with the ip67 resistance rating and they come with two cables in the box which is a welcomed addition If on the other hand you work out in a crowded or noisy gym and prefer a headset that blocks or cancels a lot of noise so you can focus on your music and workout routine then consider the Apple Airpods Pro instead The Airpods Pro are compact noise cancelling truly wireless headphones Their new inear fit is more stable so they are less likely to fall out of your ears than the previous airpod design The inear fit also blocks a lot more noise passively which combined with their good ANC performance means you will be well isolated on your commute to the gym and once you start your workouts The Airpods pro have an excellent build quality that feels durable and a decent sound that provides a lot more bass than the previous airpods They also last about 53 hours on a single charge with 5 additional charges in the case so they should easily last you throughout the day and even have enough battery if you forget to charge them over night Unfortunately like other Apple headphones they do not have a dedicated app for customization options which makes them a feel a little bland overall and they only have an IPX4 rating which means they will be less water and sweat resistant than the some of the other options on this list If you want the best option for sports overall then go for the jaybird Tarah Pro They provide the best bang for your bucks for any sports headphones weve tested so far Theyre compact breathable stable and easy to use They also have a great build quality and an IPX7 rating for water and sweat resistance They have a comfortable earbud like design that doesnt enter the ear canal as deeply as typical inears while still providing enough isolation that you will barely hear whats going on around you with a little music playing They have a decently balanced sound out of the box and like the Vista have access to the jaybirds mysound app which gives them a wealth of customization options including a fully parametric EQ They last about 13 hours on a single charge and will automatically turn off to conserve power which you can enable and disable within the app Unfortunately they come with a pretty restrictive charging cradle so you wont be able to charge the headphones without it If you prefer a truly wireless design then the Vista maybe at the better alternative but for most the Tarah pro provide the best value and options for a wireless sports design So to quickly Summarize If you need a budget wireless option for the gym then the upgraded Anker Soundbuds Curve are a great choice or the you can opt for the Soundpeats true free if you prefer a truly wireless design In that sense if you want a truly wireless design and have a bigger budget then you have the option between the Jaybird Vista Jabra Elite 75t and the Powerbeats Pro If you prefer an open design so you can be aware of whats going on in your environment as you work out then the AfterShokz Aeropex are a good choice especially since the bone conduction tech leaves your ears wide open And inversely if you need something to block the noise of a crowed gym then check out the noise cancelling Apple Airpods Pro Lastly for the best bang for your bucks you cant go wrong with the Jaybird Tarah Pro Theyre a great allaround sports headphone that are only somewhat limited by their proprietary charging cradle And thats pretty much it A couple of notable mentions that didnt make the cut The Jabra Elite Active 45e They have earbud like fit good customization options and would be a decent option for running outdoors due to the semi open design However they do not keep your ears as open as the Aeropex The Beats Studio 3 are a stable overear design that wont be the best for the gym since its not very breathable and make your ears quite hot but provides a more comfortable fit than inears for some especially if youre not a big fan of inears and ear bud design You can also go for the Solo Pro is you like this design but prefer a smaller onear format And finally the JBL Endurance Peak Theyre a truly wireless earhook design thats stable for sports and sounds decent but do not quite outperform the Beats Powerbeats Pro theyre also a bit more difficult to use but are cheaper though which may be worth it for some And thats pretty much it You can check out all our measurements and reviews for the

hope you all had a great Diwali and to make it even more awesome and back with a brand new video and one more good news for you guys is Ill also be doing a special giveaway in the video so make sure you watch this video till the end the product well be reviewing today is Sonys brand new budget wireless headphones the CH 510 theyre a brand new model and I guess these are the most affordable wireless headphones from the company so the new headphones come in this sort of box packing their Bluetooth v 50 and even have a picture of the product on the front as you can see weve got two colours here black and blue and Ill be giving away one of them to you guys well talk about the giveaway details at a later part in the video lets see whats written on the box packing the Bluetooth v 50 support fast charging have a builtin microphone also support voice assistant function and come with a USB typec port so those were some of its features now lets get started with the unboxing let me grab my knife and cut the seal on the box there you go lets open it and check out the product okay so on the inside weve got another plain cardboard box that phones must be packed inside this thing lets check him out so here they are the new wireless headphones from Sony come packed like this in a cover and along with that we also got some packet of accessories first let me show you the headphones so this is how Sonys new W head CH 510 wireless headphones look like wow I like this deep blue color so before I give you all a closer look let me also show you all the accessories over here you get a USB typec cable for charging the headphones and user manual thats it these are all the items you got in the box alright then let me also unbox the black color variant and show you how they look sidebyside okay guys Im back so here are both the Sony headphones the blue one on the right and the black on the left lets have a closer look at them and talk about the design and the build quality the sony CH 510 have a simple yet beautiful looking design weve got the sony branding on both the ear cups and I have to mention theyre super lightweight in the hand they only around 132 grams talking about the design the entire headphone has this textured finish all over it and the bodys entirely made of plastic the CH 510 have a supraaural style design that means they sit on top of the ears instead of covering them fully their cups are rotatable up to 90 degrees theyre quite flexible and the headband is also extendable to fit almost any head size just like this talking about the cushioning the ear cups on it come with good quality cushions that feels soft and nice when you press them and I guess theyre made of artificial leather thats it there is no cushioning or padding under the headband alright let me show you all the available controls and ports on the headphone weve got the media control buttons on the right side which includes a volume up multifunction button and a volume down the quality of the button see also nice and feel tactile and clicky going to the right weve got a type C port for charging a tiny bluetooth status LED indicator and a microphone that said these are all the available controls on it there is nothing on the other side let me also give you a quick look at the black color model so which one did you like guys leave your thoughts in the comment section down below alright what Ill do now is Ill just power them on pair them with my phone and talk about the comfort and the audio quality the Sonys new ch 510 a super lightweight and looked pretty good when you wear them but in terms of comfort theyre not the best Ive seen in this price especially the headband because theres no cushioning or padding over there it feels a bit hard after some time talking about the audio the audio quality was very good nothing less expected from Sony these headphones are close dynamic type and have 30 mm drivers in them the mid spelled crisp and clear the vocal clarity was great and I could easily understand all the dialogues its quite a frequency response range from 20 Hertz to 20 kilohertz and I felt the treble quality was decent coming to the bass the lowfrequency response was nice it was producing good and punchy bass on door rollers quite happy with the audio quality for the price the distortion of also minimum even at max volume and the audio output also loud inside is fine Ive already mentioned before I did got a builtin microphone and the mic quality is decent during call conversations now let me tell you about the battery life the battery life on these headphones was excellent on an average at 70 volume level I was easily getting around 30 to 32 hours of continuous music playtime and the best part is they also support quick charging the company says a ten minute charge offers you up to 90 minutes of playtime awesome right well that was my review on Sonys new CH 510 wireless headphones theyre a good quality product feels super lightweight the audio quality is nice and the battery life is also excellent the only thing I felt was the comfort section could have been slightly improved and also the price could have been a bit lower the cost around four thousand nine ninety rupees Ill just leave a link to them in the description box below and yes I know you all have been waiting for this let me tell you about the giveaway Ill be giving away one of these awesome Sony headphones on my channel to participate all you need to do is you need to follow me on my social media accounts like Instagram Facebook and

"collection_date": "20201007 102247004570", "video_id": "Xt1S1gxnOwU", "Closed Captions": " whats up guys Im drizzle diesel from risen Escom today were comparing the beats power beats Pro to the power beats 3 so were gonna talk about the legitimate reasons to spend more on a true wireless version or why you might settle with the power beats 3 so hopefully you enjoy the video and you want to be a part of our team if thats the case give us a big thumbs up subscribe to the channel well put more information about both of these products down below in the description like other comparisons and stuff that you can check out and well cover some of their similarities as well lets get to it ok so in terms of the areas where theyre similar obviously theyre both Beats products owned by Apple they have a very similar overall form factor its a little bit different the power beats Pro are a little bit sleeker slimmer and more lightweight and they have more of an angular look to them but for the most part they have basically the same design around the earhook design that has a really secure comfortable fit they basically have the same controls its a little bit different on how they place them on the earbuds but you get the main multifunction button and you get volume rockers on the power beats 3 its an inline system with the power beats Pro its actually on the earbuds but dont worry I have they actually do a really good job of placing them on the earbuds so it doesnt make them any less comfortable doesnt make it any less convenient in fact it might make it a little bit more convenient so overall similar design basically the same functions in terms of the buttons and because Apple owns beats theres really deep integration with iOS devices so the pairing process is really easy and then once you have them paired with one device thats signed in to your iCloud account all your other devices that are signed in iCloud like your MacBook or your iMac or iPad those will automatically recognize the earbuds so you can easily switch between devices thats super convenient now the power beats Pro have Apples new h1 chip and the power beats 3 have the w1 chip there are a few things that will differ as a result of the different chip well talk about those but just you know they do have that special bluetooth chip from Apple and as far as like waterproof rating goes theyre pretty similar right the power beats pro or ipx4 certified which is like hey you can run in the rain you can sweat like crazy youll be fine and its basically the same thing for the power beats 3 even though they just say its water and sweat resistance so why get the power beats 3 over the pro given that the pro are newer theyre the latest and greatest youd think that theyre better so lets talk about that first the big thing is price right the power beats pro 250 dollars you know thats on the upper end of what I can expect consumers to pay for a pair of wireless earbuds thats actually pretty expensive power beats 3 you can usually find them for about 150 120 dollars if you check out our website Rizzos comm or you can download our ios and android mobile app we look for deals every day on beats products jaybird apple and all the other brands you actually care about and we dont sell anything we just find great deals you can check that out down below in the description I know that we find really good deals on beats products in particular so yeah as youd expect theres a big price difference between the power beats Pro in the three and I think some people might make decisions based on that theyre gonna say basically look theyre gonna do the same things for me do I need true Wireless versus regular Wireless maybe its not worth the price difference the other thing is because the power beats three have the actual cable that connects them they have that inline mic and I found that its a little bit more clear for phone calls I really dont have any complaints with the power beats Pro they actually do a really good job but given that the microphones a little closer to your mouth if you have the the actual cable dangling in front of your face they can be perhaps maybe a little better for phone calls but thats really it you know theyre kind of old so it probably comes down to I like the fit theyre comfortable for me and Im fine with using wireless versus true Wireless so why spend up for the power beats Pro obviously the the biggest thing is that theyre true Wireless the second thing is that they have that h1 chip so you can activate Siri by just saying hey Siri call Matt Ross hey Siri add Pro teen bars to my shopping list so you dont actually have to press any buttons it has that standard wake word just like the new air pods and theres no lag  it works really well I could see people paying up for that convenient feature also I think they probably have the better audio quality this is tough you know because were dealing with products from the same brands but Id rather listen to music with the power beats Pro to mean they sound a little bit deeper richer and more full I can tell a little bit more in the mids like when I listen to country music Id rather listen to it on the power beats Pro than the the power beats 3 the power beats 3 arent bad I mean theres theres probably millions of people that use them and love them but Ive had to split hairs I probably give the edge to the power beats Pro and then also on the battery life front so 9 hours on a single charge with the Pro Plus about 15 to 18 hours in the charge case you add that together getting over 24 hours of battery life whereas you get about 12 with the power beats 3 on a single charge yes the power beats 3 are better 9 hours 12 hours actually pretty close and then as for the fast fuel charging feature five minutes with the power beats Pro gets you oneandahalf hours 15 minutes gets you four and a half hours with the power beats 3 a 5 minute charge gets you an hour worth of playback time so a little bit of a difference there but it actually helps health the power beats Pro so really a lot of this stuff comes down to can you afford them if you can objectively the power beats pro or the better way to go I dont think they make a whole lot of sacrifices other than the price tag right the microphone I think its gonna be fine audio qualitys good fit comfort its all good waterproof rating they are the better set of earbuds but it really comes down to what you want in your earbuds so let me know what you think write us down below in the comments well obviously linked both of them in the description so you can check them out I think if you can afford them the power beats Pro are better theyre the way to go but if you cant you know clearly the power beats 3 are really popular for a reason people like them they have all the other advantages like comfort and and all that stuff have a great day Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music

a review for the school candy gym plus wireless earbuds so lets get started if you havent yet make sure to give this video a thumbs up and smash that subscribe button so you dont miss out on more great content so lets unbox these of your buds and Ill show you whats inside so what you getting inside the box you get a users guide a plastic bag of goodies with a different size ear tips large and small and on the ear tips right now theyre the middle size and a microUSB and a plastic clip and you get the earbuds themselves so lets talk about the specs on these earbuds it has no plug type because theres a wireless earbuds it has an integrated microphone it has called connect and disconnect control integrated volume control and integrated functional control it has 24 GHz transmission frequency with Bluetooth 50 builtin with a range around 33 feet and finally thats called track and volume control and I did test a waterproof ability on these earbuds and they did surprisingly well with a waterproof ability they went above and beyond my expectations like I wasnt expecting these to be even waterproof like I know they gotta have this micro USB splash cover so like if it does drop in water like a few seconds its not gonna hurt it but like you can take a shower with these on and if you drop them in the water for a few seconds there its definitely not gonna hurt it and these are your buds have six hours of battery life ok lets get back on with the review so lets take a look at the earbuds themselves so lets start on the right ear bud it has the ARF so you can let you know its right on the hook that helps you keep it in your ear it is detachable also if you want to take it off and also this ear tip is detachable so you can put a smaller or larger size on so lets head down to rubber cable and then we come to the counterweight of further remote it just has a school candy logo on it and some recycling information another stuff so if we go down here where the cord goes around your neck we get all the way down to the actual remote and its a splash resistant cover on the micro USB slot with up and down volume controls and a pause button and a safe if youre like so on Spotify or something you can use this to pause and play Im gonna leave that users guide in the description down below but the users guide you can like double tap this and go forward and then you could like triple tech tap back for like track back or something like that so if we head down here its just a reverse of on the other side and also theres a school candy logo right there I dont know if you can see it there you go and the plastic in the remote feels kind of cheap but after a few days I kind of got used to it it would yeah its just normal now the counterweight is a little bit heavier in my opinion than the actual remote so like if you had it in one ear the ear boat would tend to drag the counterweight down on the counterweight drag the whole thing down and it just made it really uncomfortable so everyone really recommend doing that a whole lot its just kind of uncomfortable unless you got like the clip supporting it that I think thats what this book is for I wouldnt really recommend doing it with one a year its just kind of uncomfortable and unconvenient so lets connect these wireless earbuds to bluetooth so when youre connecting to iOS you want to flip this up and you want to make sure that the Bluetooth symbol the symbol is blue then you want to scroll back down and then you want to go to settings and Bluetooth and then you want to go to wireless earbuds hold down on it and there will be a voice prompt saying power on and it will be flashing like this saying it hasnt been paired yet and then you just want to look for kid plus and connect the earbuds to Bluetooth and then the voice prompt will say connected so lets get on with the report of our everyday testing so during the time of our everyday testing I went out and did a lot of numerous things with these earbuds right off the bat is I got these headphones out of the box I was like hmm these are these seem good quality and dont get me wrong they are but like I said first the plastic felt kind of cheap at first but I got used to it and then I started listening to music with these earbuds for a few hours I listened to some Spotify with these earbuds for a few hours and I realized they kind of left on base a little bit but if you turn them up gradually will start getting the bass but if youre just like listening to it really low youre not gonna be able to get the bass that youre looking for well theyre 15 here but so what do you really expect with the bass but other than that I didnt have any problems with these earbuds if youre looking for some wireless earbuds and youre looking for the bass but you listen to music kind of low then these earbuds theyre just not really for you but if youre just looking for some Wireless youre but to get the job done like take some phone calls or listen to a little bit of music or watch YouTube videos and then go ahead these are great but overall I cute these earbuds like a seven out of ten I probably would have given it a nine its just that the plastic feels kind of cheap sometimes and it lacks on bass I have a link below to the Amazon affiliate link to these earbuds in the description and if you buy the earbuds from my feeling it link down below it really helps support the channel and it gets me paid and Id really appreciate it help support the channel Im also gonna have a written review in the description down below so go check that out its on my website geeks and games and it goes into a little bit more detail on the specs of these earbuds and take you guys so much for watching this video if you havent

"C3o2dD4QhHY", "Closed Captions": " so Ill have your Bernina welcome back to the channel today I have for you my review of the Under Armour sport wireless headphones by JBL these are great headphones that have good quality audio but they also have a really good locking mechanism so that once you put them in your ear theyre not coming out till you want them so thank you very much to Verizon for allowing me to check out these headphones but lets not waste any time I want to check them out I want to share with you guys what I think after using these guys for about a month now and here is the Box Under Armor sport wireless headphones made by JPL these are bluetooth headphones connecting to both Android or iOS some of the main benefits of course are the twist and lock as I mentioned to you guys this is going to be really functional for people that love having their headphones in and never wanting them to come out unless they want to durable built for resistance obviously since this is going to be sport sweatproof be able to be against sweat when youre playing and doing all your activities JBL sounds so pure bass performance this is something that were gonna talk a little bit more with the sound quality experience we have a microphone and inline microphone with volume up and down of course answering and hanging upon phone calls up to 8 hours of battery roughly if youre running about 50 volume a little bit less if youre running around 80 75 80 or closer to 90 and of course bluetooth wireless with great range its supposed to also include 12 month premium membership to map my run you can download the application from either the Google Play Store or the iOS App Store looking at the contents of the box we have a lot of things in here we have a silicon kind of like a soft a silicon case that does include the microUSB to USB type a charging cable also matches the color red that we have on the actual headphones we have some instruction manuals as well as that map my run thing that I told you guys mine didnt actually have the code but thats okay I do actually use runtastic you can use any other application of course but the main benefit is that it does supposed to include a oneyear membership to that and we have a few sizes for the ear cups and Ill explain to you guys what they are as well as de are tips and I think those are the small and large one but they do also come with ones preinstalled looking over at the actual tips themselves you have the ear tip right here thats removable and this is one of the ones that you can overplay theyre not easily taken out but then once you do take them out its easily replaced and again you can take them out to clean them of course and as well as the actual bigger piece here now this actually helps the configuration to be able to lock into your ear as it actually gets inserted to the actual year and then lockdown and Ill show that to you guys in a second we do have a marking here for right as well as left and they work pretty good the sound quality that we get out of here is pretty comparable to regular over the years or even you know on IRAs headphones the main thing you want to keep in mind is obviously these are not straight in they do sit on in your side your ear so theyre gonna give you good quality audio but not exactly total isolation from the outside the inline remote is very nice we do have a microphone on the back we have a micro USB port thats nicely covered here for the sweat proof resistance connected here that youll be able to charge up the device the other thing is and in just make sure when youre done okay put it back flush an LED would red and blue indicators a power on right now its on and they have it connected to my device start and stop for music answer and hang up for calls as well as volume for our volume up and volume down and skip forward and skip back by pressing and holding for a little bit longer than just suppress so if you press and hold on the volume up skips forward pressing hold on the volume down and skips back now pairing them is pretty simple you press it turn them on for the first time if theyre not pair that will ask you to pair and again double work with Android or iOS and theyre independent theyre basically just connect to your device and theyll connect and work with it now as far as the volume up and volume down the one cool thing I want to mention to you guys is it has its own independent volume so when Im raising the volume up or down here you notice its not raising it on my device so you have the ability of going to a hundred percent on your phone as well as a hundred percent on the headphones the range on this is actually pretty decent about twenty feet Ive been able to go through now the reason behind that is theres gonna be obstacles so if youre working out in the in the gym and youre within about 20 feet of your bag and your phone is in your bag youre going to be pretty solid you can skip forward as far as track skip back pause and stop the music of course ants are called its not gonna play any notifications or anything like that thats not part of the service but again overall I think its pretty good as I mentioned to you guys the locking technology on this is extremely done well so essentially you just take the tip you put it as if youre pretty inserted into your ear and then lock down and its solid you do the same thing down and these are not going anywhere this is actually jokingly I tried a couple of times to be asked you see how much weight can I put on it before they kind of pop out and I was actually able to put substantial amount of weight and he still didnt come out I like to put them in the front as I like to keep basically access to my remote you can of course put them in the back when you were working out I think it finds it better if you dont want it to bounce too much for you just clip the money shirt and that stops the bouncing and overall it works pretty good now as far as audio quality were gonna go through it a little bit of different examples this is going to be a really good headphones for exercising which means youre gonna be listening to music youre gonna be enjoying them its not going to be overly powerful thats not gonna give you that massive shower you know bass in your head like I said you found are youre bouncing in this height its gonna be basically good the bass levels are pretty decent depending on how high your volume gets youre gonna get all these to get louder bass overall I think the mids and highs are okay as far as the performance with vocals that sounds pretty good although some of the quality and some of the details doesnt get lost but its not as sharp thats the best way to describe it when I compare them to other headphones at least but when Im working out honestly Im not sitting there and Im not looking for the detail Im looking to have basically good music banging music whatever it is be it either electronica you know trance dance EDM all of those things or even when Im sitting around and I just wanna listen to maybe some more vocal music in the car or even on the bus I found out they actually pretty comfortable the way they sit in your ear and thats because they actually dont sit inside the ear drum they actually sit right inside of the actual opening in your ear so its a natural position for them so extended wear its actually pretty good lets go ahead and start off some music and Ill give you guys some more you usually looking for a pair of headphones that are going to be really good for you and stay with you for a long amount of time these deliver the way these things were marketed is that these are workout headphones do you need them to give you good audio a long battery life as well as good controls to be able to kind of get you a volume up skip forward not having to have your phone on you all the time so the audio is going to be good enough for what youre doing because when youre working out youre not sitting there and saying oh I want the massive bass you want good enough sound good enough phase to get you through and give you that stamina that youre trying to get out of that on music that youre listening to I think the construction and the battery life and the range is really good good distance range if you dont want to have your phone on you as well as the quality of the audio and if you turn them off youre still able to listen to the sounds outside of the around you so you dont have to take out the headphones every time to talk to somebody I think thats a nice feature that people may have skipped you can answer calls hanging up and all of those things sound pretty good actually when I was using them as a as far as using them and make calls the other side had no idea I was wearing a headphone so the audio quality is really good as the microphones closer to your face let me know what you guys think in the comments below thank you very much to Verizon for allowing me to check these guys out these are definitely my favorite headphones for working out and as I like to run and I like to do a lot of different things and I dont want to have to tangle and play and readjust headphones like and subscribe as usual thank you very much for the support link in the description of course for all the information regarding these headphones and where to be able to pick them out thank you for the support as usual again Ill see you guys in the next video", "video_title": "Under Armour Ipx5 Sport Wireless Headphones By JBL Are The Best For Working Out

up to 600 bucks but headphones are so personal whether your choice is on ear over ear in ear noise canceling or not theres any number of features that you have to choose from these days im aaron from tech gadgets canadacom and today ive got my very first pair of beats by dre headphones beats are super popular theyre really slick looking and yes theyre definitely very expensive so are they worth the hype stick around to find out the solo 3 are indeed wireless though they do come with a cable you can use if the battery runs dry though thats possibly unlikely because these come with a 40 hour battery life theres also fast fuel charging which with about five minutes of charging will give you up to three hours of battery life perfect if youve drained the battery forgotten to charge them and youve got somewhere to be how well did the battery last I had them for a few weeks and tried them on and off for an hour or two here and there and it didnt even make a dent in the battery setting these up was instant you connect them using your devices Bluetooth menu and theyre ready to go in seconds the package comes with that cable I mentioned a carry case and a charging cord the headphones will also collapse down so theyre much easier to store happily the beats by dre solo three wireless headphones remember which device youve connected to previously the second you turn them on theyll reconnect to the last device so theres no fussing with your phones bluetooth menu normally I dont really like on ear headphones I find the pressure on my ears tends to kind of get achy after a while but with these the potted ear cups are really soft and comfortable and they block out a ton of noise as well youve also got the padded headband and theyre fully adjustable the solo 3 Wireless have easy to find controls on the side of the ear cups to let you hit play pause or control the volume theres also a builtin microphone so you can use the phone for handsfree calling theres also a handy light up battery gauge on the ear cup which tells you at a glance how much power youve got left for the most part I found the phone call quality on the beats solo 3 to be pretty good I could hear really well and the person on the other end of the phone that I was talking to said I sounded great and they can hear me just fine to where I did run into a snag though is with ambhi Nois anytime there was any kind of noise happening in the background music playing people talking things like that the person on the other end complained it was really distracting so whats the sound quality like overall the beats by dre solo three Wireless sounded really good I was actually really surprised and impressed with the quality overall I think the bass obviously is really strong really noticeable but its not that kind of jaw jarring bone crushing bass that you can get with some headphones its just really good there was also no hiss or distortion in the high end particularly when I had it on really high volume overall I just loved how these sounded and combined with how comfortable they were to wear I have to say beats by dre has really impressed me overall Ive been really impressed by how much the beats by dre solo 3 do live up to the hype theyre comfortable they sound great theyre compact and easy to travel with so I wouldnt hesitate to buy a pair of them for myself or to recommend them to others if youd like a little more detail than I can give you in a short video review Ive got a full written review online at tech gadgets Canada comm I hope youll go there and check

can get headphones from 20 to 600  Choosing headphones is personal and everyone has a preference whether its onear over ear in ear noise cancelling or not and of course sound quality comes into play big time\nRead more on these headphones at httperinlyyccom20170906beatsbydresolo3wirelessheadphonesreview\n\nTwitter  Instagram ErinLYYC\n\nI had a chance to test out my first pair of Beats by Dre headphones these are the Solo3 Wireless  Beats are slick looking popular and expensive so are they worth the hype Lets find out\n\nThe solo 3 wireless are indeed wireless though they do come with a cable you can use if the battery runs dry I think thats handy but with these theres a 40 hour battery life Theyve also got fast fuel charging which will give you an additional 2 hours of power on just a 5 minute charge Super handy if you forgot to charge them and youve gotta run\n\nSet Up\nSetting these up was instant  You connect to them using your devices Bluetooth menu and theyre ready to go in seconds The package comes with that cable I mentioned a carry case and a charging cord The headphones will also collapse down so theyre easier to store\n\nHappily the Beats by Dre Solo3 Wireless remember which device youve connected to perviously and as soon as you turn them on they connect automatically  No fussing with your Bluetooth settings every time like some other headphones Ive reviewed\n\nI normally dont like onear headphones I find they hurt my ears after a while  But surprisingly I found these really comfortable The padding is cushiony and the wrap is soft The headband is padded to and theyre adjustable of course\n\nThe Solo3 wireless have easy to find controls on the side of the ear cups that let you playpause your music or control volume Theres also a built in mic so you can use the phone for hands free calling\n\nI found the call quality excellent  Its very clear no breakup and folks on the other end said they could hear me just fine when it was quiet  When I had lots of noise in the background it was noticeable to callers on the other end Even when I plugged in the cable with its inline mic background noise made a phone conversation impossible\n\nA handy light up battery gauge on the ear cup tells you at a glance how much power youve got\n\n\n So how do they sound  Excellent The thick ear cups keep outside noise from bleeding in which lets you focus on the music\n\nThe bass is outstanding but not bone rattling the voice track is crisp and clear and theres absolutely no hiss or distortion even at high volumes Taylor Swifts crackly reverby Ready for It was clear and fun  Both 13 and Decades sounded rich and layered and it was easy to pick out individual instruments The bass was intense and thumpingly pleasant on Why We Thugs and Sir Slys High The retrosounding Feel It Still had crisp vocals alongside deep bass and nothing sounded muddy or muted\n\nFull Test Playlist\n13  Allan Rayman\nFeel It Still  Portugal The Man\nMen in Black  Will Smith\nWhy We Thugs  Ice Cube\nBurning Bridges   Foo Fighters\nReady For It  Taylor Swift\nDecades  Matthew Good\nHigh  Sir Sly\n\n\n\nI cant make any complaints about the sound and in fact i was quite surprised at how good they sounded  Ive tried a lot of headphones and these have immediate shot up to one of my top 3 picks I  would definitely buy a pair of these for myself and recommend them\n\nOverall I was pleasantly surprised that Beats by Dre solo 3 wireless actually live up to the hype Theyre not cheap  they sell for about 300CAD so they are an investment but so far they seem like a good one", "video_like_count": "5210", "video_thumbnail": "httpsiytimgcomvis_zKwDCzSwhqdefaultjpg"}

"video_id": "uZfSu9meft4", "Closed Captions": " so its been 24 hours with the brandnew air pods Pro but are they worth two hundred and forty dollars and more importantly can I finally get rid of all my other headphones such as my sony WF 1000 XM threes I dont know were gonna find out in todays episode of iconic creators tech reviews whats up icons my name is Kim refuse founder of iconic and today I want to talk about the new Apple earpods Pro now Ive been traveling for three years straight all over the world running my business and Ive been trying to find the perfect headphones now my favorite before are just the Apple earpods probably the coolest thing I own closed piece of technology I own is the Apple earpods I absolutely love them I actually do not like earbuds at all they make my ears hurt they give me a headache and something about just the simple and simplicity of the plastic Apple earpods I absolutely love cells actually nervous and pretty disappointed to hear that the earpods Pro were actually multisized rubber ear pods or air pods if whatever you want to call ear buds ear pods the same thing just about two months ago Sony released the WUF 1000 XM 3 and I was like the marketing and the commercial they did for these ear buds was absolutely amazing I was like this is it these might be my Apple earpods replacement and Apple had not released anything about letting people know that there might be a new set of ear pods theyre gonna be noise cancelling coming out very very soon so its like hey Im gonna give these a shot these look absolutely amazing but problem with these things is that theyre probably the most uncomfortable earbuds Ive ever worn and I cant workout in them because they fall out if I go to on the treadmill they fall out instantly and mission I lost the package with the replacement sized ear bud sizing which is so freakin annoying and thats why the Apple earpods are so convenient because theres no rubber things you got to carry around these I went to the manufacturer the Sony was like hey I lost him theyre like whoa we got to order them and Im like Im not gonna be here that long to wait around for you to order them I travel full time so that was a big disappointment and now these are basically rendered useless they hurt my ears they fall out in addition when youre wearing these and the touch buttons on this are just not good now when I put these in theyre like okay not too bad but it to do any sort of touching like thats how you control earbuds as you swipe on them and like my hands are little sweaty right now I just got recently got back from the gym so Im just like okay what what am I supposed to do here bud because thats how you do it you swipe back and forth on this thing or you hold it and if you try to swipe on this thing and your hands are at all even sweaty or anything especially when I workout in these a lot its just instantly Im just sitting here going like okay whats up  __  right like thats not fun these are very uncomfortable I was actually impressed for the first 12 hours I could say with the Sonys and then 24 hours later they basically became useless and I went right back to my always trusty most amazing piece of technology I own the original Apple earpods now for traveling I always enjoyed both of these the Bose QuietComfort QC 35 and the Sony WH 1000x increase both absolutely amazing no complaints about either of these headphones theyre both  __  awesome I dont prefer one over the other theyre both great but I really only use these in a loud environment andor if Im traveling which brings me to the Apple noise canceling air pods now I was really nervous again because theyre rubber and I was like I dont want to have to deal with carrying around you know other rubber things are these gonna be comfortable and its been 24 hours since Ive owned these air pods and I will say that there was two times in the last 24 hours where I had to take him out because I wasnt playing music and I just realized that theyre in there and Im like get out get out of my ears because I noticed that they were there and for something a reason about ear pods it bothers me with the original ear pods I could leave these in all day and not even realize that they were there so I will say that I had to take these out twice in the last 24 hours but overall compared to these sony earbuds these are absolutely magnificent and when I put them in the noise canceling is absolutely astonishing like Im mind blown how well this works I would say theyre almost operable to the sony wh 1000 XM threes as far as noise cancelling however they do it in addition I dont have to carry these big things around like I dont even know if I can wear these headphones with this hat on without like being weird I dont know thats not bad its its cozy but with the air pods Im really happy with it Im in Shanghai China at the moment I was riding on the subway listening to music I couldnt hear a thing or anybody talking whatsoever just totally in my zone and totally in my element so I will say within the first 24 hours I did have to take them out twice because they were bothering me a little bit while I was working overall Im extremely happy in mind blowing with the quality and the sound cancelling of the air pod so now I want to talk about the features alright so talking about the features of the air pods Pro its a 24hour charging case I will say that they fit into these slots slightly better than the original air pods like originally with these I would always put the right in the left and left in the right and I would have to like go back and forth but these I dont have even have to think about it for some reason I just instinctually put them in and I believe they do you last yes four and a half hours for the actual air pods I dont know if that was that the same as their packs or more more more than the original air pods which is nice in addition they have these little air vents on each of the actual buds which allow you to turn not totally off the noise canceling but you can hear the ambient sound around you so that when you pop them in as opposed to this going fully quiet mode here you actually squeeze right or left now Im in full just turning it on it just turned on into full audio noise cancellation it just basically you feel like you just got sucked into like a little theater dome room and youre just all sitting in your own little world then you just hold it again and then also I can hear the ambient noise and almost like I can hear myself talking through a microphone but the whatever theyre doing with the noise cancellation now when I just turned this off these little air vents that are these little black slits just allowed err to transfer through and allow you to actually hear and it also gives like you a little bit less pressure on your ears like I said before earbuds if I have him in too long they always give me a headache they always make my ears hurt and it just like get out of my  __  head I had to do it twice in the last 24 hours but both situations I wasnt listening to any music I like had just been working then Ill sit in the music stop while it basically there it is in noise cancellation mode or an ambient sound and I wasnt actually using them but theyre still my ears and I got annoyed and had to take him out but when I was listening to music it sounds great and I didnt have to actually you know realize that this was being a nuisance in my ear so it was when theyre in my ear and I wasnt actually using him that really started to annoy me some of the other features that actually has audio sharing so if you want to connect to your macbook connect your iPhone connect to your iPad you can have multiple devices if you want to watch a movie with a friend on a plane or something and actually share the audio device with the air pods which is actually cool and also within the app when you swipe down the actual little air pod button pops up here you see the little icon and then you can click and hold you can actually turn off transparency or noise cancellation mode within the app as opposed to having to actually squeeze it or you can just turn it fully off now its fully off now it just kind of sounds weird ya know the transparency now I feel like Im talking through a microphone noise cancellation you literally go into your own little world with these with the Sonys or the other Sony earbuds or even the Sony over ears I dont feel like I go into an underworld whatever theyre doing with the Apple earpods Im going into another little peaceful world of my own and I dont know how exactly theyre doing it but its pretty freakin amazing alright guys so I wanted to talk about the actual audio controls Im using Spotify right now now like I said before trying to use the actual touch audio controls in the Sony WF 1000 xm3 earbuds was like impossible especially at the gym you swipe or do anything that is fly out of your ears same with even the WH 1000 XM 3 so knees like he kind of had these like weird hard swipes on it and I I just ended up not doing it so I wanted to try out the air pod Pro touch controls and Im actually really impressed this might be the only headphones where I actually might use the touch features because its just very simple now to pause and play the actual video all you do is just do one little squeeze now its playing that was easy theres actually a little clicking sound that you hear inside of the headphone and then if you want to stop it boom that was easy if you want to skip the track its just doubleclick it works but wait I want to go back to this truck again triple tap now Im gonna stop it and now Im gonna hold this to get my ambient sound back so I can hear Steve Jobs your spirit lives on bro I love you but thats basically it for the review of the air pods like what are my thoughts I think theyre  __  awesome I think the Sony WF X and threes suck dick I love the Sony WH XM 3 but do I want to carry these around all the time I basically only use these when Im flying so I have yet to fly with the air pods Pro if these actually work great on a plane and I dont have to wear these big bad boys when Im sleeping on a plane which is also annoying because if Im sleeping on a plane and Im like leaning my head up and I got this big thing and then of my ear pod goes or air headphones go like this and its very uncomfortable sleep so I would love to be able to replace these on a plane but overall verdict I absolutely love the air Paz Pro Apple strikes again before these were the coolest pieces of technology that I own now Apple earpods Pro strikes again I highly recommend them anyways guys thanks for tuning in to todays iconic creators tech review of the Apple

"video_id": "BSo7FlykqpQ", "Closed Captions": " whats up guys Im Jeff Rizzo from where uh Briz knows calm thats the best website ever and I promise you it will always be forever so as you can see with the title of the video were gonna be doing a review of the jlabbe epic sport which are wireless workout headphones actually the ones Im wearing right now it would be very odd Dillon if I was wearing other headphones and I was reviewing these anyway so these are 99 bucks Ill link them down below in the description so you can check them out for yourself throughout this entire video were also going to be comparing them to the jbird X 3s and that beats power beats 3 were gonna kind of see how they stack up in certain areas so if you find the video helpful and make sure to give us a thumbs up and then subscribe if youre into this stuff we do tons of videos about tech and workout equipment and so if youre into that stuff this is the right channel for you lets get to it Music okay so youve probably seen jlabbe products around the epic twos were actually really popular Ive seen some other websites that said theyre the best wireless workout headphones so the epics poor are basically just an improvement in a few areas over the epic  so the first area is theyre now more water resistant so they used to be ip55 certified now theyre ip66 certified and basically what that means is you can sweat all over them you can take them out like right now its raining outside you can take them out for a rainy day run but one thing is you should not swim with them and dont get in a habit of submerging the headphones and by the way bluetooth doesnt transmit underwater anyway so just dont use them for swimming the other thing they did is they now have bluetooth 42 as opposed to a Bluetooth 40 so the connection is going to be better but its not really that impressive for Bluetooth range and stability Id say its pretty much on par with the jaybird X 3s and a lot of other headphones out there walls doors people like the pain train they can kind of mess up that signal sometimes and even with the clear lineofsight you can expect like 30 to 50 feet before you get some sort of signal interference I would say the beats power beats 3 are probably the best in class for a Bluetooth range and stability they just kind of beat the pants off everyone else its much better with the epic sports than it was with the epic twos but its not quite up to the beats standards its about on par with the jaybird X threes the last thing they did is they added three different EQ settings so you can have basically different sounds signatures depending on your preferences so they have one thats called balanced which should be renamed flat because its shallow raspy lacks depth if you listen to it youll be able to know that it is the balanced one and you probably wont use it and they also have signature which is the jlabbe signature audio settings and thats the one that I would use it sounds the best of all three it has pretty good mids and highs generally its very clear and as a little bit of bass but you know not that much bass and then they also have bass boost which as youd expect has a lot more bass but it actually doesnt sound that good I dont think that youll probably want to use that one it is nice now though that you have all of these different EQ settings but I think most people are just gonna end up using signature over all the audio qualities headphones are good but not great I think good enough for most gym goers though now in terms of changing you know your audio preferences or your sound signature or whatever you want to call it the EQ settings I actually prefer the way jaybird does it they use an app and you can control pretty much everything and create your own specific sound signature within that app of course that means you have to use an app with the jlabbe epic sports you actually just click the volume up and the volume down button at the same time and then youll cycle through all three so its kind of like whichever one you like better I also like the fact that within the jaybird app you have that find my buds feature if you lose your headphones which Ive done plenty of times now in terms of the fit this is a really subjective point its like I like some headphones you may not like the headphones in general I think the jlabbe sports are really comfortable and they have a pretty secure fit and they do come with five different sets of GL ear tips and then three different sets of GL ear fins so you should be able to find a combination that best fits your ears I was disappointed though because they didnt come with the comply of foam tips because those are the ones that I prefer to use I think you get better sound isolation because they expand and fill up your ear canal and they just are really really comfortable but its still really nice that you have five different sets of ear tips and a bunch of ear fins to boots now on top of that I never really felt like these headphones would fall off my head like I work out pretty hard and I work out quite regularly and even when I was running this monstrous hill that my girlfriend made me run I never felt like there were gonna fall off my head and Im not gonna lie I definitely walked when Amelia wasnt looking when I was supposed to be running the hill now I do like how they wrap around your ear thats how I use some of my other headphones thats kind of the way the power beats 3 to it for me I couldnt get the best fit with my ears I just couldnt get that great sound isolation like I similar to the powerbeats three thats kind of how I feel about those as well but theres a lot of people that just say Im completely crazy and the fit is perfect so its like on it like on a yearbyyear basis so you know you kind of got a triumph for yourself the flip side of that though is since I couldnt get a great seal I could hear the ambient noise around me which some runners may like especially in like urban areas because it can be like a safety feature of being able to hear everything around you now the epic sports theyre also going to come with in addition to that your tips and your fins will come with a cable slider and a cable clip so if you want to clip it to your shirt so it doesnt move around or if you want to like adjust the length of the cord you can do that as well its really standard with workout headphones I dont love having like the extra cable around my neck to me it kind of just dont knows me having this flop around on my neck thats why with the X 3s I really like that you have the option to string it up along your head so its really snug against your head you dont have to worry about this extra cable but again its its really standard the epic sports also come with a full inline remote and microphone you probably expected that essentially volume buttons pause play answer phone calls skip tracks all that stuff pretty standard nothing really special the buttons arent especially tactile or clicky but the I do like that the remote is rather light so it doesnt weigh on the the cable and it doesnt kind of flail around and get in your way I had that issue with the jbird freedoms and the freedom twos because they have a larger remote so you dont really have that issue with the epic sports but possibly the best thing about the jlabbe epic sports is the battery life so jlabbe says theyre gonna get around twelve hours on a single charge we had them go ten we had them go 11 we had them go 14 it all depends on the volume but its gonna be right around 12 hours I think on average for people at like you know 60 70 percent volume right in and around that range battery life is really good the thing I didnt like about the whole charging and battery thing was that they require a proprietary charger which kind of sucks cuz thats just another cable that I need to remember to bring with me and I always forget that cable but again thats standard with headphones to kind of have that the X 3s have proprietary charger I just dont love it and then they also dont have to my knowledge a quick charge feature like youll see on the beats X or the power beats 3 its not really a I guess a game changer but that would be nice to have as well so overall I do like the Jayla but epic sports theyre not my favorite headphones ever I think theyre pretty good for most people out there Id say for me theyre about on par with the beats power beats 3 in terms of comfort and fit and audio quality I do think the jaybird x3 still sound the best I think they have the bestinclass audio and those are some pretty fantastic headphones but when you look at battery life beats and jlabbe kind of win theyre right around 12 hours maybe a little bit more for beats but jaybird is definitely in third place right around eight to nine hours on a single charge now which one would I go with because Im hoping that you care about my opinion Im actually just gonna stick with the jaybird xrays and this is all taking to account price the x3 is 130 bucks I find them all the time for like 100 or under Ill link them in the description or if youre looking for deals on headphones and stuff definitely check out our website or you can download our free mobile app it just hit 60000 downloads we dont sell stuff like when we find deals we dont were not actually selling it will just post about them every day and we post the top 100 deals of the day jlabbe beats jaybird they pop up all the time and we can definitely save you money on them so Id say price point is actually kind of similar so the X threes are still my honesttogoodness favorite headphones that I use every single day Id say like I said before the J lab epic sports for me are kind of on par with the power beats 3 theres lots to like about them but they just dont fit my ears great now Amelia my buddy Harry Dan they all say that these fit their ears better so its something that you gotta try out for yourself I think Beats probably has a little bit better build quality and I do like that they have that quick charge feature but again youre gonna pay up for that and these guys are right around 99 bucks and youll probably seem discounted in the future yada yada yada thats it for the video I would love to hear which one you would go with like which headphones would you pick out of the three and why you would do that write me down below in the comments Ill see you guys next time have a great day Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music", "video_title": "JLab Epic Sport

talk to you guys about some headphones that are highly requested by a lot of my viewers So I recently did a review of the Tao Tronics BH060 I kinda wasnt feeling those headphones they kinda had some quirks that I really didnt like So you know but I still reviewed them and you know you guys did like that review but in the comment section of that video I got some requests for a brand new one from them called the BH046 I hadnt heard of those Reached out to Tao Tronics they sent them over so now were making the video So just to be clear for full disclosure before we go any further Tao Tronics did send out these headphones free of charge for the purposes of this review Now if this is your first time here youre not familiar with the way that I do things Whether the company sends out the product or if I go out and buy it myself Im always gonna keep it 100 real with you guys And let you know whether or not its worth your hard earned money So with that said lets get right into it Alright so just some quick details about the Tao Tronics BH046 so you can find these on Amazon right now for 9999 Ill leave a link to that in the description box down below But theres also a 20 dollar off coupon So all you gotta do is click that little box thats right under the price and theyll be 80 bucks for you So not bad Now just to be clear that is an Amazon affiliate link So if you guys buy those products I do get a small percentage of that sale at no additional cost to you I just wanted to make that clear and get that outta the way Now these headphones are featuring bluetooth 50 theyve got 30 hours of playback time But more on that in the review They also have a rapid charge feature pretty dope Well talk about that in a sec 40 mm drivers and they also include a really nice case the aux cable micro USB charging cable and that airline adaptor thing that they include with a lot of different headphones Never used one but they do include it so its a nice touch So now thats outta the way lets talk about some of things that I dont like and well get into the things that I do like So first and its gonna seem a little bit nitpicky is the fact that theyre still using micro USB for charging 2019 I mean they even have them in the description as a 2019 headphone yet were still using micro USB And I know theres a ton of people out there ton of products ton of phones that still run micro USB but still 2019 I was hoping that wed be kind of moving forward start putting more products you know using type C as a standard But maybe thatll happen next year I dont know But thats sort of a little gripe for me I like to not have to carry a micro USB cable if I have the option But it is what it is Secondly the battery life So the battery life was a little bit weird So theyre talking about 30 hours worth of playback time Fresh out of the box I was able to pull 14 hours at 80 volume with the ANC turned on Now thats just fresh out of the box Thats without you know taking them out and givin em a full charge So Im a assuming they had maybe a half charge something like that So giving the benefit of the doubt went ahead and recharged them and fully charged I managed to pull 21 hours out of these with the ANC turned on and at 80 volume ANC turned off I got closer to 24 hours Still not bad but definitely not the 30 hours that they are claiming Now Im sure if you know I turned the volume all they way down or something maybe I could squeeze out more battery life out of them I dont know But the 30 hours not really it So that being said those are things that I kinda dont like about em But lets get into the things I do like And well start off in the same area in the same topic the battery life So they do feature a rapid recharge feature This I do like So what that means is if theyre totally dead you can charge them for five minutes and itll give you two hours worth of playback time Thats legit And if you wanna fully recharge em from dead only takes 45 minutes thats pretty sweet Thats something that I wanna start seeing in more headphones movin in You know to 2019 and 2020 that rapid recharge feature thats clutch If your headphones happen to die out on you and you could just you know charge em up in under and hour thats whats up Thats a major plus for me And then youve got the connectivity So bluetooth 50 no lag no latency when watching videos You know both on my iphone 10s the galaxy S8 plus and OnePlus 6T no lag whatsoever with the only exception is being the Youtube app With the only exception being the Youtube app for IOS For whatever reason with that app on IOS I still get some video lag despite which headphones I use it still happens But beyond that I mean any other app for both android and IOS no lag or latency whatsoever And then theres no connection issues I dont have it dropping out I dont have you know where its stuttering or disconnecting or anything like that Pairing is super quick and easy You know you turn em on they automatically get into auto pairing mode And you know if youre one of those people that leave your bluetooth on on your phone you know itll basically auto pair as soon as you power em up So as long as its a trusted and remembered device it will auto pair to your device I think thats pretty dope And then as far as range goes you know I managed to get right around 3035 feet You know walk around the backyard walk around my apartment at work The only time I started having any kind of stuttering or any kind of lag or delay is when I start pushing you know putting walls between my device and the headphones you start having some issues then But thats to be expected And then next up we have the call quality So these do feature that CVC 60 which is clear voice capture you know using the mics to get you know higher call quality As far as the calls comin in it sounds really really good I can hear people they can hear me But I did record a sound clip for you guys Ill let you guys hear that now Alright so Im just calling you to do a quick sound test on the microphones built into the Tao Tronics headphones how do I sound  Male You sound alright man I can hear you  El Jefe Alright cool man Just wanna make sure Im coming through clear  Male Yep  El Jefe Alright thanks man  Male No problem  So what do you guys think of that call quality Is it something you could work with Let me know down in the comment section Next up lets talk about the comfort and easily one of my favorite things about these headphones So these have to be one of the most comfortable headphones that Ive tried in a long time So they are very generously padded as far as the head band goes and on the ear cushions And I mean this is like leading comfort like you know I have the bald head so I get you know Im sensitive to them not having enough padding on the headband These not an issue whatsoever I can wear these for extended periods of time and without ant fatigue either on my ears or on the head So thats a major win for these Not only that theyre also very light weight which really caught me by surprise but they dont feel cheap they have a good build quality to em But you know nice and light weight combine that with all the extra padding on the ear cushions and the headband and like I said these are easily some of the best and most comfortable headphones that Ive worn in a good long time So if comfort is key which it is to me which it should be to you these are a definite win in that department And then last but not least lets talk about the sound quality and the active noise canceling So first lets talk about the volume These plenty of volume Now anything above 90 gets a bit to loud for me You shouldnt be listening to your headphones at max volume anyway to be completely honest Because all youre doing is damaging your hearing So when I see people doing that stuff and listening to them at max max volume and stuff man thats just not good for you man You know I wanna be able to hear stuff I wanna be able to enjoy my music until my old age So Im not gonna be listening to the stuff at max volume So to me anything above 90 on these it just gets way to loud So normally for me comfortable anywhere from like 6570 to about 8085 is perfect for me So as far as the volume goes you know whether youre watching like a video that has some speech or some you know people are talking and its very low youve got some good head room so you can turn it up and you can hear em So theres plenty of volume itll have you covered for whatever you need And then as far as the sound quality So to me these seem like theyre more of a I would say maybe like a V shaped sound So you got really good bass you got some nice highs mid range a little bit reduced So if youre gonna be listening to hiphop or trap or EDM things like that these are really gonna shine But its not limited to that So I tested these with a ton of different genres you know classical reggae latin music rock hiphop EDM trap stuff like that So I tested it with all types of genres If youre interested in the playlist that I use Ill leave a link to my Spotify playlist in the video description if you wanna check that out But across all genres everything sounded really really good Trebles nice and clear bass is nice and deep and nothing is overpowering nothing is over blown And the only time that it gets slightly slightly muddy is in the mid range but its really not bad especially considering the price that youre paying for these And then active noise canceling So your active noise canceling on these does not hurt the sound quality Thats a major win Tao Tronics Considering that was a major gripe I hade with the BH060s On the BH046 not an issue Now the noise canceling itself so it works very well It eliminates a ton of low frequency noise So you know Im not talking about speech Im not talking about kids crying or high pitched noises and things like that its not for that its for low end noise So like engine noise or like if you have equipment in your office or wherever you might be or even if youre gonna take a flight and you wanna knock down some of that engine roaring this is where these shine Knocking it down that low frequency sound very good for that sorta thing So as far noise canceling goes I would pit these against something like the soundforce space MCs you know something like that or soundcore live twos as far as you know budget noise cancellation goes So would I recommend you guys go out and pick up the Tao Tronics BH046 absolutely Especially right now that you can get em for 20 dollars off at 80 bucks These are a great deal Sound quality ANC and that comfort dude take it from your boy El Jefe the Tao Tronics BH046 are legit Its a good total package headphone for under a 100 bucks Im really glad Im really happy to see the Tao Tronics really stepped up with these and not only in the styling which I do like the way that theyre styled but comfort sound everything just the complete package Its a win So for your boy El Jefe man I highly recommend these But let me know what you guys think Do you guys see yourselves picking up a set of these let me know down in the comment section Do you guys have a recommendation on a different headphone something similar to this maybe under a 100 bucks let me know You guys know I love hearing your suggestions And if you guys

friends how are you do not realize a beautiful day here today my area and I bring you what is a boxing review of some bluetooth headphones wireless from the away brand in headphones that have a good very good priced at  29 they look great so lets start with what on the xbox and of the complete review already before going on to open what the box we see that we They offer outside that they mention us we have of course what is a photo here of the headphones look pretty good at least in the box lets see how they look when we open them we have what the bluetooth name here we have what It is the aiwa brand the same and the model is must be this and bhp 16 a do not say here bluetooh wireless headset with microphone included which allows you to take calls make receive calls as you see here also says it supports any type of device that supports bluetooth He also mentions lombardi live here that is the battery is Long says here that an average of up to 100 hours in standby mode and up to about 5 hours playing music on the back of the box we have what is another photo and this time we see what the bent headphones are which therefore allow us to have more commented portability available that can be folded apart from that friends mention kiessling design software leslie dynamics exterior sound lombardi live then lets go start opening the box yes to see how the hearing aids look like I already see I took the headphones out of the box to buy a little time lets see here what we have put the headphones here aside and apparently they include us here I assume that it is to the cables and the guarantee indeed we have here what which is a usb cable also an audio cable also to connect only to hearing aids when you do not want to use them with battery or in case the battery to now lets see what hearing aids are ok friends lets see what the headphones offer us apparently what they are the controls are all on this side we have here what is the control of the volume  without further ado the pause and what the play button for the play option here we have what the play button on and off also what is to the button also for the mode of bluetooth here we have what is to a light when it goes down is the headphones the light here turns on and off and also when it is in bluetooth mode and here we have what is the usb port for the charger and here we have what is a port to connect a cable audio when you want to use it without the battery and finally we have here a small hole which is the microphone that allows you to take or receive calls with the headphones on the other side we have no controls at all apart from that seeing what the glasses are the glasses rotate upwards and down however they dont do it to the sides other than to mention like I showed you in the box earlier the headphones can be folded which makes them quite portable quite compact as far as what it is the color and the material as you realize in this black part here It is a bright color and on the inside it is a red color of a finish matte is not glossy on the inside we have what is the logo that says ay wave with the letter l indicating the left side and the other side as well says ay wave indicating the right side with the r fin apart from that friends here at the top we have a surface that is quite soft quite comfortable which will help when you have your hearing aids on so you feel comfortable and another thing to mention the headphones can be expanded as you give account expand quite long expand and I lie here they are flexible As I mentioned earlier the hearing aid price is 29 99 I found it a stieg and imax store so lets connect them to the phone so we can give you my opinion of how they sound what is the quality Im also going to put on the headphones so you can see how they look Since we are now to turn on the headphones we simply press here for two or three seconds we are going to see what a pulsating light is here we are going to do it now 123 and we see what the place was like and we leave it for a while and as you see the light is pulsing in blue and red now simply we spent here on the phone turn on the mode bluetooth and we should see at some point here what what are the hearing aids we have to do a scan and we must see here the name there it is hp 64 16 we click there and as you can see we are already connected so Im going to put on the headphones and listen to some music to give you what the opinion is Im going to go and put on the headphones now Im going to leave my cap so that you see that there is no problem as to what these expansion expand quite long and this is the left side this is the right side your first impression as to what comfort is what is cup will be feels quite comfortable the truth is not a problem with that as you see the headphones expand quite long and personally I dont like the space that you see here but apart from that they feel comfortable I think they look ok im going to turn around so you can see how they look and here we have what is the left side and we have what is the top now Im going to come over here to play some music on the phone to give you what is in my opinion to the quality I do not expect it to be the best so lets see lets see what I can tell you here we are playing music lets turn up the volume and we are going to also assume the volume in what this side of here where the volume at the rear wow guys really the quality is amazing the bass is great as to raise the volume more wow I really really did not expect the quality offered by headphones the truth is that it is quite good bass feels very very good quality all frequencies feel very well for a price of 29 99 I think that the sound is very very good in terms of what is the quality of the hearing aids on the outside does not offer the best quality but nevertheless they are not bad as you see offers very good flexibility they can be expanded you can fold them so friends thanks for the video this was what the hearing aids were there are

guys Scott from tech break here to do another product comparison for you today Im going to compare the Sony WH 1000x m3s to the Beats Studio 3 Wireless Im gonna do a complete review Ive had these each for about a month now have used both of them in several different environments and have a pretty good idea which one Im gonna choose and one of them has stood out as a lot better than the other so stay tuned to see which one that is so to kick things off I really was actually biased towards these when I first got these Im a huge Apple fan everything I own is Apple except these two monitors here but Im a huge fan of the W one ship that I have in my ear pods I use my air pods all the time I travel for work and so Im always on the road and so I thought I was naturally going to be a fan of these both of them were supposed to have really good sound quality the reviews on both are really really positive so lets dive in and see what I really thought about both of them first and foremost is the packaging lets be honest I dont really care how theyre packaged so Im gonna set this packaging aside and dive right in all right so lets just dig right in the packaging you can see they fold up a little bit differently again I prefer the Sonys packaging to the beets the beets are a little bit easier to fold up but I feel like the Sonys it just since it lays a little bit flatter and Ive got a dedicated spot for the cable versus having to make sure my cable doesnt fall out every time which its not in there right now every time I take the beets out is a point for something as far as the fit goes I felt like this the beets were a little bit tighter on my head and the Sonys were a little bit looser so if youre going to use them at the gym which I never really do my primary use is while Im working one on an airplane and thus ownage just felt a little bit looser on top of that the ear pads are a little bit bigger on the Sonys I feel like my ears actually fit inside them as opposed to be the beats just sitting on my ears after wearing for several hours I felt like my ears and to break with the beats and with the Sony I never really feel like that speaking of wearing for hours the battery life on the beats is 22 hours while the Sonys boasts 30 hours of battery life on that battery life they both come with active noise cancellation and to be honest that was something that I didnt know if I would use or not my ears are supersensitive maybe Im part Dalek but I always feel like when I have noise canceling turned on my ears feel like they have some ringing in them and I cant get it to go away I did feel and I dont know how to best describe this but I think the Sonys noise cancellation is a little bit smoother than the the beats I didnt seem to notice it as much whereas with the Beats I I could still notice it after you know 15 20 minutes of wearing it or sound quality goes there was a clear winner here and thats the Sonys the beats I would think after with all the research and development dollars that have gone into building this brand I would think they would have better sound quality I just felt like the the highs werent as good the lows werent as good the bass wasnt as crisp so huge when to the sony on this so if you care about the quality of the audio i thats probably most important for me than the sonys are a clear winner the controls as far as the controls go sony has a sort of a slide touch control on the earpiece whereas beats has actual buttons actually prefer the controls of the beats over the sonys ive found it difficult to swipe the right way because when youre wearing the headphones they kind of that your pieces kind of tilt a little bit so am I supposed to swipe up at an angle am I supposed to swipe straight towards my eye I just never felt like I could get a good handle on on how the controls were supposed to work price as of right now the beats are 80 cheaper than the Sonys but Ill keep current pricing down below in the description of this video so you can stay on top of what the prices are but even given the 80 differential I would still buy the Sonys over the beats so there you have it the clear winner here are the

thing youll need to decide is what formfactor you prefer Do you want overear headphones onear headphones or inear headphones Before we get started with our video detailing the best wireless headphones on the market we have included links in the description for each product mentioned so make sure you check those out to see which one is in your budget range Starting off with the best overall wireless headphones we have the Sennheiser Momentum 20 Which Bluetooth headphones should you get if you want the best of the best In our testing the best wireless headphones money can buy are the Sennheiser Momentum 20 Wireless overear headphones There are a number of things that make these headphones so good For starters they look beautiful The headphones are built with premium leather along with a strong metal frame and a rustic look Its a great combination but the build doesnt just make them goodlooking  it also makes them nice and strong While the headphones do have an overear design they are somewhat portable They fold up and fit into a nice strong case which is included in your purchase The case is great for those of you who want to take your cans on the go The Sennheiser headphones are comfortable too They have nice memory foam in the earcups and while we would have liked to see a little more foam in the headband thats not a dealbreaker by any means Then theres the sound which is the highlight of these headphones The Sennheiser Wireless overear headphones boast a deep rich lowend along with a welltuned and accurate midrange and crisp highend They also have noise cancellation and while its a little annoying that you cant deactivate it if you want it well help keep that extra noise out so you can listen to your music in peace Were not the only ones who love the Sennheiser Momentum 20 Wireless headphones They scored 910 in a review from Headphone Review and their predecessor the Momentum Wireless 20 headphones scored 910 on Trusted Review and 45 on CNET The main downside to these headphones is that theyre not cheap To get them youll need to shell out a cool 350 to 500 but if you do you wont be sorry Next up we have the best noisecanceling wireless headphones which go to the Bose QuietComfort 35 Bose is a powerhouse in the headphone world and has been especially successful when it comes to noise cancelling headphones In our testing the headphones with the best noise cancellation technology are the Bose QuietComfort 35 headphones When these cans are on the noise cancellation is almost eerie The headphones arent just great for noise cancellation Theyre extremely comfortable and sound great too Sure the design isnt all that interesting but for many people that doesnt matter as much as the noise cancellation technology and sound quality If youre into customizing your cans to suit your personality you can design your own headphone on Boses website The Bose QuietComfort 35 headphones also come with everything youll need to take them on planes and around town including a nice carry case plane adapter and an aux cable for when you want to use them in wired mode Speaking of which wired mode is unfortunately the only time you can use these headphones without noise cancellation on Theres no switch to turn it off when theyre connected through Bluetooth Plenty of reviewers loved the headphones besides us Trusted Reviews gave them 910 CNET gave them 455 and Headphone Review gave them 910 They are a little pricey coming in at 299 to 350 but paying that will get you the best noise canceling headphones around Up next we have the best onear wireless headphones which go to the AKG N60 NC Looking for something a little more portable than the overear Sennheiser Wireless headphones The AKG N60 NC Wireless headphones could be the ones for you The headphones feature a super sleek design with a black and silver color scheme along with an onear form factor which makes them a lot more portable than overear headphones Theyre made even more portable with their swiveling earcups which help the headphones fit nice and snugly in the included carry bag The AKG N60 NC headphones are comfortable too Theres a good amount of memory foam in both the earcups and the headband The best thing about these headphones however is that they sound great Theres a ton of lowend frequencies though the bass doesnt go overboard The high frequencies are nice and clear too which helps the music sound crisp Next up is the fact that these headphones also feature noise cancellation thats better than youll find on many other headphones Its not quite as good as the Bose QuietComfort 35s tech but its good nonetheless The headphones arent perfect In the pair we tested there was a small amount of Bluetooth noise which came in the form of a very faint buzzing in the background You couldnt hear it while music was playing but it was a little annoying Others liked the N60 NC Wireless headphones too They scored 8710 on Headphone Review The Verge also liked them during their preview PCMag gave them 4 out of 5 stars and Time also praised them The headphones are a little pricey at 150 but more affordable than our top pick Next we have the best wireless headphones for less than 150 which goes to the JBL E55BT Looking to buy a great pair of Bluetooth headphones on a budget Just because you dont have a ton of cash doesnt mean you cant get some great headphones In our testing the JBL E55BT headphones are the best headphones under 150 For starters unlike plenty of other headphones these come with a very fun design You can get them in a ton of colors including red black blue green and white They also fold up so theyre somewhat portable and can be taken on the go The headphones dont just look good they sound good too They could use a little more in the highmids frequency range but apart from that they offer plenty of bass and a crisp concise highend which makes for some greatsounding music Theyre on the better end of the spectrum with battery life too A single charge will get you 20 hours of listening time The headphones have reviews like the 45 rating on PCMag and 8110 on Headphone Review And as mentioned the JBL E55BT headphones are relatively cheap with an original price of 14995 At the time of the video they were on sale for 10995 on Amazon Next we have the best wireless headphones for great sound which goes to the Master amp Dynamics MW50 The best Bluetooth headphones need to sound great feel nice and look good  especially since theyll command a high price Thankfully Master amp Dynamic delivered with the MW50 From the first time you put them on youll appreciate their feel and things will only improve when you actually start listening to music Because music has to get compressed when sent wirelessly from your phone to your Bluetooth headphones you end up losing the little details that make songs special No Bluetooth headphones at least not right now will give you every nuance youll hear with a highend pair of wired ones but the MW50s performance is excellent I was able to pick up on sonic subtleties that would get lost or sound muddy on lesser pairs and that was true regardless of what I was listening to Music encoded at a lower bitrate would sound worse but that was more a matter of the MW50s exposing flaws in the files rather than making them sound that way There is a new version of this pair or headphones which has newer Bluetooth connectivity standards but youll pay a bit more for them at 399 as opposed to 29599 Second from last we have the best wireless headphones for less than 50 which goes to the iFrogzs Impulse Duo These iFrogz headphones made the best earbuds guide so Im just going to echo what I said there below Besides sounding pretty good for the price the reason iFrogz Impulse Duo earbuds made the cut over all the other budget models Ive tried is their design The dual driver construction is what gives these earbuds an audioedge over the competition But mostly these earbuds succeed where most Bluetooth models fail Instead of having all of their technology built into an unwieldy dongle that hangs off the cable connecting both buds iFrogz built it all into a magnetic clip Clip the dongle onto your clothes pop in the earbuds and youre ready to listen to music In terms of audio quality you shouldnt expect a truly audiophile experience for less than 50 but dont expect a bad one either These are actually the upgraded version of the earbuds iFrogz released last year and while the design is the same time was spent in improving the sound quality Ill put it to you this way These headphones are so easy to use and sound good enough that theyre my goto pair between reviews Its just so convenient to coil them up and pop them in my pocket after a commute or once my friends finally make it to our meeting place Now for our last pick we have the best wireless headphones for travelers we have the Sony WH1000XM3 Noise canceling is becoming a common feature for many Bluetooth headphones and for good reason Its nice to block out the rest of the world during your morning commute or to block out the screaming kid in front of you on the plane Sonys headphones have the best noise cancellation of any headphones  Bluetooth or otherwise  that Ive ever tested On a plane ride from New York to San Francisco the only thing I heard was the music I put on Without any music the noise canceling feature was able to block out a lot of ambient noise which should also appeal to you if youre looking to sleep en route to your destination This pair of headphones also has a few smart features thanks to touch controls on the right ear cup Placing your hand on the ear cup activates the microphone letting you hear noise like a pilots announcement while lowering your music As someone who put this feature to the test while traveling it was surprisingly useful Noisecanceling aside these headphones are comfortable to wear for extended periods of time and sound very good overall The audio quality wasnt as high as some other pairs Ive heard but noise canceling actually does color the sound a little bit Still its a fair tradeoff for such a nice feature So that sums up our top wireless headphones of 2019 We hope you enjoyed If you did please leave a like on the video and if youre new here hit that subscribe button Until next time have a great

FCC certification and the fact that its made in China lets open up the lid Im struggling to open all that lets try again yep this is not opening ok maybe Im doing something wrong lets have a look at instructions so in here we have micro USB cable some earbuds and these have holders within them so the earbuds with means of security in your earlobes when during sport and another set of earlobe holders and things so these are quite handy if you prefer different colors or accessorizing with your running gear as you do sports with your Bluetooth headset but lets look at the details themselves so it says push here to open thats where we were probably going wrong so we need to push there nope Im struggling here let me try it off camera yep and definitely struggling with this I will pause the video first I go and see if the instructions can illuminate me on how to open this packaging just a moment okay then I have successfully opened that it took quite a lot of pushing on the bottom so this case closes very very securely and is quite a large one as far as bluetooth headphone lets go so the earphones themselves are simple pair of buns and you can see theres the Pogo connectors on the underside to them the ear plug style noise isolating silicon buds that actually wedge into here and these over earlobe hooks that will keep them stable last year for example running or doing sport so this is obviously a sport products I will now synchronize these with my Google pixel 3xl lets make that happen so to turn them on you need to long press the button on the side and then youll have flashing but I believe youll need to search on the Bluetooth on my device so theres a Xiaomi phone I definitely know which one that is and my me been three and Candices me ban three and a smart band I believe ID or is a tws lets see its a bit of a guess here lets try tws and I hear the tws earbuds l which Im assuming are the holy high earbuds are connected Im now going to go into my Google Play Music app and put the earbuds in and see what the sounds is like what shall we test with this my usual test music which is Jennifer page there we go go with some classics right I will try these out and then provide you with some first impressions once Im finished okay then Im back Ive tried the holy hiee 1018 waterproof buds with a variety of songs and podcasts and audiobooks and I have to say the sound is quite good they have a decent amount of bass they reproduce sound pretty well in my opinion and they fit quite nicely in my ear I like the fact that this medium to small buds fits nicely and and then you have the extra reassurance of this hook that goes around your earlobe and the stereo worked well I had no issues with that and as you saw the setup with my Google pixel 3 XL was very very simple so Im very happy with that the one thing Id say is obviously the first time I opened these probably because theyre new it was quite tough it took me a while to do it the second time but then from there on I love that you need your fingernail underneath here and push and then lift so its a push and lift not just a lift which is good if youre carrying them around in a bag or if you were to drop them youre less likely to have this challenge in opening them but as I said the fact that they have a leaflet in here means that were not the first people to have had an issue opening them and Im having the same issue again anyway um thanks to holy high for providing us with this review device we will be doing a full review on the tech travel geeks website soon once I can open the packaging the casing and we will be linking to Amazon in the description to this video you will also get a 15 discount cards discount voucher which we will put in the description thats provided by holy high who provided us with this review unit which were struggling to open the case to yes I think this this case issue is a bit of a problem the fact that they have a leaflet in it to describe the issue is interesting it seems to be that you need to push the very top of the lid in for the crook to open which is good but anyway apart from that as you can see the moment I open the case they reconnected to my phone and started playing music apart from that these are a very good pair of headphones for the price which is around about 40 pounds sterling under 40 pound sterling and I will be putting them through their paces before doing a full review thanks for watching a room I need to practice I need to practice opening the case yep I definitely do if you enjoyed this video and my

headphones under 2000superbasssuper bass headphonesmi bluetooth headphones", "idx": "359", "channel_id": "UCRuLCSq22at2KO07ZBTI9vA", "collection_date": "20201007 102247364867", "video_id": "dL8NNNHa8zU", "Closed Captions": " Whenever someone asks me to suggest a wireless headphone below the 2000 Rs price point I just tell them to either stick to wired gear or increase their budget to 3000 Rs Because making a decent enough headphone in my opinion is almost impossible at this price point Because even decent enough earpads alone cost around 2000 Rs Hey guys I am Siddharthand if Id give a benefit of doubt to any company it would be Xiaomi because they really set new benchmarks for value in all segments they make products in So lets find out if their new Super Bass Wireless Headphone is good enough or not So the headphone has a well thought out design they really have tried to make the most of what they could use at this price point In spite of being made with not so premium plastic it feels solid and theres no cheap feeling creaking noises The earpads are pretty decent for the price the earcups do have some adjustment and the headband cushion also works well The earpads are actually removable which I wasnt expecting at this price point The buttons are well placed and are easy to reach and you can play pause and change tracks and receive call with these You also have a 35mm in port for using it in wired mode along with a micro USB port for charging and you do get cables for them in the box The comfort on these is also pretty decent for on ear headphones these are light and the ear pads are soft so you can wear these for about an hour comfortably But since these are on ears they are going to hurt your ears after some time and if you wear glasses like me its going to be difficult to wear them for more than an hour One downside in my opinion is that these ear pads are going to need replacement soon and I dont know if the ear pads for these are going to be available for purchase separately Xiaomi claims 20 hour of battery life with these headphones and in my tests they easily lasted that duration which is really great This is how the microphone sounds it doesnt sound very good and the voice sounds muffled and I dont think this is going to perform well in a noisy environment But for the price I dont think that I can complain Coming to the sound quality this is an area where I was expecting a compromise A wireless headphone has to have the frame the earpads a bluetooth receiver chip DAC Amp and a battery in addition to the sound driver So while the sound quality of these headphones is actually good for the price considering what I talked about there are unfortunately some limitations with the quality of sound driver you can have even for Xiaomi Before I go further I do want to say that I really think that these are the best sounding headphones under 2000 rs I had tried a boat headphone at a similar price point and they were so bad that I decided to not make a video on it But these are great given the limitations we have here The problem is that sometimes good is just not good enough So the midbass of these headphones is boosted and I guess thats why it has Super Bass in its name But the bass extension doesnt go low so the bass is pretty mediocre The mids are passable for me but they do get kind of muffled with the super bass of these headphones The highs are pretty bad theres no clarity and the instrument separation is also bad so everything kind of mixes into each other Nowt I understand that these are not meant to be audiophile headphones but the reason I am criticising the sound so much is that you can get MUCH better sound quality by spending 500 or a 1000 Rs more The Blitzwolf true wireless earphones that I reviewed sound a lot better while offering true wireless advantage and if you are looking for better battery life the loop audio earphones are a really great option they have one of the best sound signatures in the segment and the microphone is also much better And yes I know that these are earphones and not headphones but you have to ask yourself why are you interested in buying a headphone in the first place especially when youre on a budget Its because you want better sound quality and comfort and you are not going to get either of that with these headphones in spite of how good they are for the price So in conclusion if you really want a headphone instead of an earphone and you really cant spend more than a 5001000 Rs then yes These are probably the best option They do check all the boxes of a good headphone for their price But I think its better to save up and get something thats actually usable instead of wasting your money on an underwhelming product and I have said great things about audio gear that costs 800 Rs so I am not being an audio elitist who thinks anything that costs below 10000 Rs sucks Ill have my links in the video description if you have decided to buy these along with recommendations for the other devices that I mentioned with their reviews so make sure you check all of that out But before I end this I have to say that Xiaomi has done something really impressive with making a headphone thats as good as this but they cant change the laws of economics or sell headphones at a loss and thats why these headphones in particular do not get my recommendation So that was it for this review feel free to share your thoughts in the comments section below Subscribe to the channel with notification bell icon for more videos like this

boy El Jefe and Im back to talk to you guys about some wireless headphones that I just picked up and I figured you guys might be interested or maybe you guys are already checking em out So what Ive got here is the Skullcandy Riff Wireless So I picked these up in the crimson and white Theyre also available in a couple of different colors but Ill leave links to all of these in the description box down below Now normally they retail for right around 50 bucks I actually picked these up when they were on sale for 30 So if youre interested in em keep an eye out for those discounts Now before we go any further and for a full disclosure I went ahead and bought these headphones myself with my own money for the purposes of this review And if youre new here and youre not sure about the way that I do things whether a company sends me the product or whether I go out and buy it myself Im always gonna keep it 100 real with you guys and let you know whether or not its worth your hard earned money So thats it lets get into it Now I came across the Skullcandy Riff Wireless headphones on Skullcandys website so I was kinda on the website kinda tooling around around Christmas time trying to find some good deals on the Hesh 3 Supras or maybe the Crusher 360s trying to see if there was any good prices to be had So a lot of the stuff was either sold out the Crushers didnt get a huge huge discount and much as I thought they would so I was kind of passing on them And as I was searching through the pages I found the Riff Wireless and I thought hey they look kinda cool Saw the price tag 30 bucks couldnt beat that I was like you know what let me go ahead and try them out see what people think People like budget headphones Ive got a lot of people that watch my videos that like budget products so I figured lets bring em in and check em out So that out of the way lets talk about em So first up let me talk to you about some of the things that I do like about these headphones and then well get into the things that I dont like So first up lets say sound quality Now the sound quality is exactly what I expected out of some Skullcandy headphones Youve got some decent bass you got good mids and the treble is okay These are nothing to write home about these arent gonna blow you away especially being that they are onear headphones theyre not overear so as far as that goes theyre very good I would consider these more like an entrylevel type of headphone than anything else But the sound quality is there Good bass good mids and some decent highs Like I said nothing too crazy but not bad The Bluetooth pairing was quick and easy also didnt experience any video latency when I was watching videos and stuff like that on my devices so thats also a plus Not only that the cushions on the ears themselves on the actual drivers nice and generous well padded they sit on top of your ears like I said they are onear headphones they sit on your ears nicely dont cause a ton of ear fatigue and so thats kind of a plus but there are some things with comfort that Im gonna get into in just a sec Theyre also very lightweight so youre not gonna have any fatigue from them weighing you down theyre very lightweight And they also have built in controls so you can do your volume your track forward track back playpause things like that thats built in right to the ear cups so its convenient and it works And then one of the other features that I do like is they do have that quick charge feature so you can charge em for 10 minutes and itll give you 2 hours worth of playback time Thats kind of a cool touch I like that that But that will lead me right into some of the things that I dont like So first up the playback time So overall even though they do have that quick charge feature the overall playback time on these is 12 hours Now if were talking 30 dollar headphone I could forgive it but the fact that these fully retail at 50 and most of the competitors that are in the 50 dollar range are pushing anywhere between 18 to 30 hours or sometimes more of playback time then 12 hours kind of aint cutting it I mean its nice having that rapid charge feature but come on man you know 12 hours So in my testing I managed to squeeze right about 11 hours and 10 minutes thats listening to them at around 70 to 80 volume So which is not bad but still you know what I mean 12 hours and you know maybe the smaller batteries might have to do with something with them being lightweight maybe its weight savings okay so be it But that brings me to another point Theyre super light but its because its a completely plastic build And with that for me they sort of feel a bit on the I dont know on the cheap side I guess you could say The plastic is nice everything looks good and professional its Skullcandy but I dont know Ive got some other headphones like some of the TaoTronics even some of the Mpows and those are in the same price bracket 40 to 50 bucks and those things are built like a freakin tank Theyve got the heavyduty plastic with the aluminum on the inside and a bunch of padding That leads me to the other thing theres no padding on the headband its just a straight plastic Sitting on this head dude laughs After about an hour I started really feeling it left a nice line over my head so if youre a baldy you may wanna stay away from these Unless youre gonna wrap that headband with something I dont know but even just a little strip of material I mean anything Skullcandy come on man Any little bit dont just leave bare plastic up there man So especially considering how cushioned the ear cups they could have thrown a little something up there right Do you guys agree do you guys disagree agree should they have done that Let me know in the comments section So and then also they do have a builtin microphone just like many other Bluetooth headphones You can answer phone calls do things like that Mic quality leaves quite a bit to be desired Obviously a headphone in this price range we have to be a little more forgiving But I wanna make that clear to you guys So with that said would I recommend you guys picking up the Skullcandy Riff Wireless If youre an avid user somebody who really loves their headphones and you wanna have the best sound experience for your money I think Im gonna pass there are some better options out there in this price range Now Skullcandy they make some good products These do have good sound quality they are very light and they have the rapid charge feature and they look cool let me give them that they do look cool But you know I just I dont know 12 hours of battery life subpar microphone and the lack of padding on the head Plus the cheap plasticy feel of them If you can get em at like 30 or 40 bucks if theyre on sale I say go for it But at full 50 nah man I mean unless youre gonna give them as a gift to someone maybe youve got a teenager or a kid who just wants some cool lookin headphones then maybe But if youre one of my fellow people I dont consider myself an audiophile but just somebody whos like an audio enthusiast somebody who enjoys their headphones and enjoys their music then you know what Its gonna have to be a pass And Im just saying this is just a basic headphone from Skullcandy they have their Hesh series they have the Crusher series so they definitely have some really solid cans but this one just leaves a bit to be desired Especially the competition in this price bracket is really bringing the heat so its gonna have to be a no from me on the Skullcandy Riff Wireless Now have you guys tried these out Do you guys agree or disagree with my assessment Let me know down in the comments section And also have you guys tried any other products any other headphones around 50 bucks Maybe 40 to 50 bucks that I should know about Leave those down there as well you guys know I love your suggestions And as always you guys liked this video go ahead and smash that like button If you guys didnt like

watching right now have them The question is Might they pose a health risk A group of 250 scientists and experts have all signed a petition expressing serious concern that these types of AirPods or headphones pose a cancer risk Question should we be worried or not Joining us via Skype to discuss is Doctor Ankur Parikh Medical Director of Precision Medicine at Cancer Treatment Centers of America Doctor Parikh obviously technology its moving at the speed of light Its hard to keep track of whether or not its safe or not safe You as an individual what are your thoughts and  or concerns Basically I dont really think theres a cancer risk per se right now I think a lot of the data thats out there is very mixed and really we need to figure out how best to interpret all of this But the amount of radiation that comes out isnt something thats gonna potentially cause longterm damage as far as we know in terms of cancer risk Honestly by having your cell phone to your ear youre gonna potentially have more radiation to your head area then you will with a wireless headphones But with children their hearing is still developing Their nervous system is still developing So when you put these wireless headphones in their ear we dont know what the longterm side effects and consequences of the radiation 10 20 or 30 years from now is going to lead up to And so what I worry about as a mom is that my kids want these the AirPods Theyve sold 28 million of these in 2016 and all the kids are wearing them and we just dont really know over time that kind of exposure By the time in 20 or 30 years these children are developing some sort of neurologic tumors or ear tumors I really feel like its too late No and I agree with you and I have three children myself and I worry about their iPad time and headphones with themselves so I think the best that we can do is just be mindful that we really dont have these answers yet But its like all things in life also Doseresponse correct Meaning since theres no identified risk yet and there are a lot of questions but these things are ubiquitous If you put them in to make a phone call okay If youre listening to some music while youre working out okay but I actually see a lot of people now theyre just in All the time All day long For hours I bet people sleep with them in because you can forget that theyre there Before I let you go is it really one of those Okay just be aware when theyre in our ears so that youre mot walking around 247 seven days a week 365 days a year Because God forbid twenty years from now we realize that there was an impact you cant go back and change the last 20 years if thats all you did was have them in our ears the whole time Is it fair to say to say to just be mindful Yes thats a great point Just be mindful when youre not calling someone not listening to music just take the headphones out of your ear Dont give yourself that extra chance or that extra risk to develop some kind of problem down the road So I think everything in moderation And do you think its safe to say Doctor Parikh for those of us who are parents with small children if they really need to use headphones for something to keep it wired until we have more data and more research to see how this plays out Yes and I think from a personal perspective as being a father of three I absolutely would Doc thanks so much for joining us Thank you audience applause And this is why I love our show because these are the kinds of questions that we dont always think about and then they come up on our show and then every single one of us all our producers everyones thinking Wait a minute thats right We dont have any data on these things so lets just be mindful And what weve learned in medicine if nothing else that its boring but moderation in most things youll always be okay And if theres ever a question as long as you moderate for the most part something like this just be mindful I love your points about kids I think thats so well put Young kids just use the wired headphones if youre not sure Are you using wireless No I dont just because Im cheap and I havent bought them yet audience laughs audience applauds They are nice they are nice Look Im going to continue to use mine when I need to Yeah but like you said in moderation If I were to acquire a pair Id probably would use it for an hour while I work out or something like that but I do see them on longdistance flights where people just have them in It might be time for the show to get Doctor Parikh a little gift I could trade you this audience laughs", "video_title": "Do

wireless earbuds that I found just the other day at my local 5 below and the really interesting thing about these is the fact that theyre not from base jacks but instead a brand that you can find in stores other than 5 below in fact that seems to be a little bit of a trend because Ive been finding Macs sell products in there as well and Ive got a theory about that which Ill cover later on in the video but for now lets take a look at the specs on the other side of the box specifically the battery life which is listed at one and a half hours and the audio driver size which is listed as 10 millimetres because those do make a difference in how these are going to perform and lets not forget the charging time which is listed at one to one and a half hours now enough gawking at the packaging let me show you what actually comes in the box so inside the box once you get are your earbuds which are quite obviously inspired by the Apple earpods you also get the charging cable which is a kind of unique little Y shaped monstrosity as well as a single sheet of very glossy paper to act as your manual now before I go any further I want to just point out you do not want to misplace your charging cable because this thing is so unique youre not gonna have an easy time tracking down a new one outside of certain situations and Ill talk about in a moment let me get this little guy out of the way first though now like I said earlier these are quite obviously a knockoff of the Apple earpods and thats not necessarily a bad thing because this design right here does a great job delivering sound and the simplicity of the design can make these kind of easy to use though at the same time the single function button can be a little obnoxious Im not gonna lie because all you have is just one button per earbud and this mainly acts as your power button though depending on how long you press the button it does different things according to the manual a single quick click will pause or play your music as well as answer incoming calls and end calls to rapid clicks will redial the last number holding it down for one and a half seconds well skip to the next track when youre not receiving a call holding it down for two to three seconds will reject an incoming call and holding it down for three to four seconds will power it off or power it on and speaking of powering them on you can actually use a single earbud if you so desire but if you turn on both earbuds they automatically sync to each other and this is true automatic unlike the Lync speakers I reviewed previously where you have to do a little hullabaloo to sync them up the first time these connected to each other right out of the box so all you really have to do is turn on the earbud like so the little flashing light indicator turns on there I dont have the Bluetooth on my phone turned on so these wont automatically sync to that but when I turn the second one on give it a second and hopefully itll automatically pair or it doesnt need my phone oh there it went okay it didnt need my phone notice how this one stopped blinking as fast the one on the right that means it is now paired with the other one but I dont really need to show you that anymore so lets turn them off there we go and that really covers all of the physical features of these earbuds outside of charging in fact let me demonstrate how to use the charging cable all you do ya shove it in like so plug it into a USB power bank and youre good to go now lets talk about my experience with the audio quality amazingly its pretty good and for that I thank the fact that they imitated the Apple earpods ein it pulls in a little extra air thinks these the little vents on the side or at least thats my theory and it makes things sound a good bit richer the base was nice the trouble was nice not muddy not tinny kind of flat which is what I like but I wont say that their monitor quality by any stretch of the imagination as an added bonus these were true stereo not mono over stereo like a lot of a lowercost Bluetooth earbuds have been recently when I did the test one of them output the right channel one of them output the left channel if something was centered it was centered it was great however it wasnt perfect it turns out at the factory they accidentally wired these backwards so the right ear bud was outputting the left channel and the left ear bud was outputting the right channel it is something that you can fix with software and its really not that noticeable unless youre finicky about it like I am but its there and thats actually where my theory comes in because this is a brand that Ive seen it stores other than five below at prices well above 5 and suspiciously these earbuds are marked as 2019 unlike some of the other overstock that you see find its way to buy below like the you say gaming earbuds that are marked as being released in 2015 so the reason I think they hit 5 below the year they came out is due to the fact that more than likely the entire batch might be crosswired aka theyre just factory seconds in fact Vivitar is one of the brands I believe Ive seen at Big Lots or at least Ive seen similar brands at Big Lots selling this exact model of earbud with an additional case for 20 and I wouldnt be surprised if they want 10 for this setup right here if they were functioning properly its kind of like the time I got really excited when I found a set of Kobe earbuds at Dollar Tree and thats see OB y by the way theyre another brand of relatively low cost tech that is definitely worth more than 1 and when I got the earbuds home what I found was that it had two left earbuds and I dont mean both earbuds were outputting the left channel no they were actually one was outputting right what was outputting left when I say two left earbuds I mean literally and they were designed so that the left earbud only fit in the left ear the right earbud only fit in the right ears which rendered that set of earbuds absolutely useless and to be honest I was going to review them a while back and then misplace them so whoops now lets get back from that ranch shall we I did mention during it though that this exact model of earbud is being sold by multiple brands and thats because its a generic from China if you check all the Express you can find this exact set up including the earbuds and the charger cable or between two to three dollars just do a search for true wireless earbuds or I believe it was I 7s tws you should find a ton of them even better if youre willing to go up to five dollars as opposed to two to three dollars you actually get the charger case so instead of getting this weird janky Y cable youll get a case that you can store your earbuds in that can be charged using a standard USB cable and the case also has a builtin batteries so when you pass the hourandahalf mark or you just reach your destination while using these earbuds you can pop them into the case hit the power button and theyll charge right back up now I dont know what kind of battery life you get out of the charger case but it is going to be more than the initial hour and a half heck they even have more colors than just wide available I know I saw black pink and I think red and they had some with patterns on them from camouflage to flames its kind of crazy theres so with all of that said you probably know my verdict on these already or at least most of it because these are not a terrible grab if you want to have a set of truly wireless earbuds that look like Apple earpods and you dont mind having potentially swapped channels and you dont want to wait up to a month to get them so yeah in that situation this isnt a bad grab for five dollars however if youre willing to wait the extra time and dig around on Aliexpress you can do so much better for so much cheaper I think that about covers it with the vivitar Tru wireless earbuds and to be perfectly honest my experience with these has me wondering whats wrong with the Maxell headphones that I keep seeing pop up at five below these days I might have to review one to find out but that is for a later date for now nzile next

be some of the best budget selling truely wireless earbuds you can pick up on Amazon I bought these myself because I had to find out exactly what makes these things so special now when you buy this product this is exactly what you get in the box you get three sets of ear tips depending on the size of your canal you can swap them out you get this little cable that can be attached to the side of the case so you can strap it on things and of course you get a charging cable now unfortunately its micro USB but again this is a 40 pair of truly wireless earbuds what makes these things so interesting though is that you get wireless charging I mean theres not a lot of 40 truly wireless earbuds that support wireless charging the case itself is made out of all plastic its a thicker case not as big as the power beats pro but definitely bigger than the air pods pro or Jabra elites now inside you have the two earbuds there nothing special in terms of design they both have one button on the side of the earbuds they are flush with the ear but itself and when you put it on its definitely not the most comfortable button to press like when you push it youre pushing into your ear and it doesnt feel satisfying unfortunately the buttons dont do much like you can basically use it to pause play or activate your phone it doesnt do anything else you cant skip tracks nor can you increase or decrease the volume now when you first take these out you pair them to your phone via bluetooth and one bud has to connect to the other bud which then connects to your phone so theres a little bit of foreplay going on but the magic happens and they work the case notifies you when theyre charging like when I have them in here right now the light up red which means the buds themselves are charging and then youll get four lights on the back to let you know how much battery life is left in the case speak in a battery life Im getting about three hours with the ear buds and then an extra nine hours if you include the charging case so youll get through the entire day but battery life is nothing compared to some of the products that have come out recently but you do get something interesting but other competing products dont have and thats ipx8 certification you could take these headphones dump them in water up to one meter for 30 minutes and theyre going to survive and thats pretty impressive for 40 bucks now sound quality is interesting like if youre listening to a lot of podcasts or songs that really emphasize the vocals these headphones sound pretty good are they gonna blow you away obviously not but theyre they do a good enough job that youll be satisfied for its price point they do push it up which means you lose out on the low end you can still hear the bass but its not as media as other truly wireless earbuds but unfortunately the call calling on this is pretty bad like you can tell it was an afterthought from this company which is weird because one of the primary functions of the button on the headphones is to answer and end phone calls I sound like a depressed robot to the other person on the other end of the line so thats exactly what the microphone sounds like this is exactly what the other person is going to hear it is not the greatest sound you can tell that voice quality was definitely an afterthought and finally audio delay I had none of it when I was watching movies or playing games so they did a good job of making sure that the audio is synced when youre watching content so heres the bottom line the total t tens are worth 40 the fact that it has wireless charging and ipx8 certification is already worth 40 bucks yes the sound quality is not the greatest but its good enough for listening to podcasts and listening to music however if youre someone whos gonna use these things for phone calls I would definitely steer clear from this product because the audio quality on this for phone calls is absolutely terrible anyways if youre

advisor here at CES and I am with the Huami Amazfit ZenBuds which are in ear sleep headphones that actually look way cooler than that sounds if you dont know Huami or Amazfit they are a wearables company so fitness trackers smartwatches that kind of thing theyve been making the mi band for Xiaomi for years and a couple years ago they expanded into their own line of amazfit they make a load watches under the bip and the Stratos and GTS lines all of that here at CES theyre basically announcing their push into the States and an expansion to more of an ecosystem business model which includes two new product lines one believe it or not is treadmills theyve announced two treadmills but more interesting for us right now is headphones so again two pairs of headphones theres one pair called the power beats which are basically pretty standard true wireless sports headphones but theyre pretty affordable what we are really interested in though is these the ZenBuds so these are inear sleep headphones so this is the case obviously get them open theres a nice sideways sliding motion which I really love and there they are those are the zenbuds what you can probably tell especially once I take them out is these are tiny they are really really really small they are also very soft that is a very sort of squidgy silicon and even the plastic here is just a little bit softer than you expect its not super tough on the ears very soft silicon pad there obviously thats important because if youre going to be wearing these things while you sleep they need to be really soft they need to be really comfortable so why the hell would you wear sleep headphones theyre not actually designed to be used as headphones Ive actually been asking Amazfit and the people Ive been asking have been a bit unclear on whether you can use these to listen to your own music or not but the main purpose is that they will play soothing sounds so basically you put these in they will play sort of a nice set of sounds I imagine you get a choice sort of like you know birds tweeting waves crashing that kind of things to help like lull you to sleep they are not noise cancelling at least not actively but the design is kind of passive noise cancellation that silicon tip will block your ear but to help keep noise out then you get the nice soothing sounds playing that will hopefully lull you to sleep then while you are sleeping and while you are falling asleep it is its got heart rate monitoring tech in there so its even from your ear its measuring your heart rate its detecting how much you move your body position that kind of thing so then youll get a full sleep report in the morning telling you about how you slept when you hit deep sleep all that kind of tracking that you might get from a watch but you can get it from inear headphones that also play music that helps lull you to sleep battery life obviously the kind of thing thats an issue most true Wireless buds would not last long enough to get you through a full night these will manage 12 hours part of the way they do that is that they will turn off the sounds once you off asleep once it detects that youre sort of are in deep sleep based on your body movement heart rate it stops the sounds thus conserves battery so that 12hour count is based on the idea that youll have three hours of sounds like three hours where youre still falling asleep and then itll do another nine hours of just the tracking so actually that should be way more than enough for most people and then you charge it up the next day ready to use the next night another little nice touch in ear alarm so if you wake up at a different time to your partner this will actually just set off an alarm that goes off in your ear so they never hear it should be enough to wake you up but whoever youre sharing a bed with wont be woken up which is a really nice little touch and just designwise these things are really lovely I mean we get that back in the case obviously weve got the swivel case the whole thing is super light because of course they dont need a big battery in the case because youre realistically  gonna charge it every day I think there might be some in the case Im not sure but its not a lot so it gives the whole thing really nice its really pretty this is a night matte finish not very fingerprinting not very glossy USBC charging and then another little touch is its just got a grippy ring there so it means when that sits on your bedside table itll be kind of static itll say still it wont get pushed around too much again because this isnt designed to be something you carry around with you like an air pods case this is something thats just meant to sit on the tables stay there and then you open it up every night get the headphones out and off you go we dont have a firm release date on these yet Ive been told probably February but well see but it will be a global release Asia Europe North America there may be a bit staggered I dont know if youll be simultaneous but thats the plan all those markets and all cost 14990 in dollars dont know pounds of euros or whatever but you can probably guess roughly where its gonna be based on that yeah so I mean I havent had a chance to use these and I dont want to put these demo models in my ears because thats icky but they look really nice they look really comfortable the concept is great Im really keen to see how these work out because I think in a asleep headphones make a lot more sense than the big over ear sleep headphones Ive seen brands  like kokoon putting out this CES so

maybe you dont want to wake your kids or your spouse if youre watching a movie late at night or you dont want to be distracted by those same family members maybe youve got noisy neighbors who were loud talkers and you just want to tune them out while youre trying to enjoy your favorite programs not to mention that if youre hard of hearing you might actually need a little more direct sound if youve done any research into getting headphones connected to your TV you know its not simple most TVs do have a headphone jack come on no one wants to run a cable 10 feet from the flatscreen to the sofa and most headphones are bluetooth and not a lot of TVs have a Bluetooth connection though you could hook something together with a wireless Bluetooth transmitter but I digress Im Aaron for Best Buy Canadas blog and the easiest way to get direct to your ears audio from your TV is with a pair of headphones dedicated to this purpose the Sennheiser RS 175 is a specialty pair of headphones but its designed to work perfectly with your TV well take a look at the setup for these the sound quality durability and more but a heads up that if you liked this video please hit that like button and give us a sub because it does help us keep making more videos so whats inside the box inside youll find the headphones of course and some rechargeable batteries that will go inside the ear cups youll get the base station plus two audio cables an analog cable and a digital optical cable theres also a power cord to get these headphones set up youll need to connect the base station to your TV receiver cable box and bar or streaming device theres two ways to connect to the base station with the digital optical audio cable if your devices are newer or using the analog 35 millimeter jack as Im connecting to an older TV I opted to use the aux cable its as simple as plugging it into the back of the base station then connecting it to your TV once connected theres a small switch on the back you do need to flip to choose which type of cable connection youre using then turn the power on to the headphones now in some setups you may also need to change your audio output settings either on the TV or the receiver these options are usually found in your devices audio settings menu a word of advice here depending on your setup you might not be able to get audio from the TVs builtin speakers or sound bar if youve redirected the sound to the headphones some configurations will only allow for one output at a time meaning if you want to go back to listening to the sound bar or your TVs internal speakers youll need to pull the plug so to speak now it is possible to connect two sets of headphones to this transmitter if you want to use more than one set to and thats worth noting also I did try to use the optical cable to connect to my secondgeneration Apple TV but no matter what I did and which settings I tried I couldnt seem to get any audio out of it I dont know if its because the Apple TV is older if it was my older LG TV or something else but either way that setup didnt work for me one other note the base station is very tall and with the headphones on its wide and bulky these might be a bit tough to hide away alright lets get straight to the heart of the matter how do they stand highs are Rs 175 sound I would say big bold and powerful to put it in a nutshell the headphones deliver a rich allencompassing sound and its easy to hear things like birds chirping outside or the distant trickle of a fountain in an episode of Bosch on Amazon Prime voices sound clear and dialogue definitely cuts through really well now music in these headphones and mainly for movies or TV themes is luscious and sounds great but listening to dedicated music like with music videos is really a delight the audio is really perfectly well balanced the sound fills your head in the best possible way the bass is really great too its not too jaw rattling but its decently deep and vibrational overall it sounds really great these headphones have two special features theres something called bass boost and surround sound bass boost increases the audio bass response while the two virtual surround sound modes offer a more spacial and livelier stereo sound effect using the bass boost provides a definite and noticeable difference in bass it adds quite a bit of lowend thats most noticeable in music or music video playback if you are watching a concert with these headphones on it would absolutely provide outstanding audio quality now the surround sound feature is similarly noticeable it does create more of a 3d audio effect where the regular setting just seems to direct the sound kind of straight into your ears the surround sound seems to me to provide a wider audio soundscape that does mimic real life and I really I enjoyed this feature so much I ended up leaving it on for most of my test time I tested these headphones out with a variety of content mainly streaming TV like Netflix and YouTube I can say theres no lag of any kind when watching content as there can be when using Bluetooth headphones to watch videos on a smartphone these headphones are big and bulky theyre definitely not made to be incognito but thats okay because youre at home right in terms of style they arent a lot to look at either but these are more about the sound quality the headphones are adjustable so you can get a good fit for your head size the ear cups are well padded and provide a good amount of insulation against any outside noise theyre bulky but theyre not overly heavy for their size these can get pretty loud  theyd be ideal for someone whos hard of hearing since they can crank it up without disturbing others theres controls on the right ear cup as well so you can adjust the volume and other settings without getting up these headphones take forever to charge up the initial charge takes about 16 hours youre supposed to get about 18 hours of listening on a single charge and provided you put the headphones back on their dock here after youre done with them in theory you should never really need to test that timing I didnt have them long enough to test them out so that I could fully wear the battery out so I cant say if that number is accurate but charging after the first powerup takes about eight and a half hours all day to recharge man that seems excessive in this world of 15minute fast charging and gadgets that are ready to go in an hour when I was using the Sennheiser RS 175 s I most often used them directly in front of the TV at a distance of about 10 feet there was zero dropouts during my test period when I was using them like this I tried getting up and walking around my main floor while wearing the headphones and again no dropouts no breakup you might be wondering if you can use these headphones with other devices the answer is no theres no Bluetooth in these headphones which is really what youd need to pair with most smartphones or tablets theres also no physical headphone jack to connect them if you wanted to connect these hardwired to anything nope these are dedicated to TV and video viewing overall if you want great headphones connected to your TV these are an outstanding choice they sound great theyre easy to setup and they have a long lasting battery downsides the charging time does take forever I also found it difficult to find a convenient place to stash the base station while still keeping it plugged into AC and the audio connection I ended up with it awkwardly wedged beside my TV during my test period these headphones are also quite pricey they sell for about three hundred and seventy nine Canadian dollars meaning theyre pretty much an investment especially considering theyre tied to your TV and your TV only overall if youre looking for durable comfortable and reliable headphones for your television that also sound phenomenal youre definitely going to love the Sennheiser RS 175 s if you want

today we are talking about the Skullcandy crusher wireless headphones these headphones were released a couple years ago and are still very popular against its newer competitors I personally picked these up for a hundred and eighteen dollars because I believe the best review should be from someone who has experience with the product as always I have my link in the description below for the most updated price if you guys want to check them out Ive been feeling they will go on sale soon so is the school candy crusher right for you lets find out in the review Music starting off with the build quality and design I really enjoy the way these headphones look and how well theyre built when I first took them out of the box I could tell right away that these headphones will last me a long time the ear cups in headband are made out of a really durable plastic and the top of the headband is made out of synthetic leather which really gives the headphones a high quality looking feel the bottom of the headband is made from a rubbery material with some padding I wish there was more padding in the headband because when I tried these on for the first time I felt some tension from the headband after a while but I have gotten used to it now and I can wear them longer without noticing anything we also have stainless steel adjustments and soft leather new cups for comfort there was definitely a bit of clamping force when I wear these but they are still comfortable enough for me and probably for most average consumers however if you are looking for the most comfortable headphones possible for very long term use then I would recommend the bose noisecanceling 700 but these things also fold up and Skullcandy included a nice pouch which makes these great for traveling in terms of buttons we have a total of four they are all very simple and easy to use on the right ear cup we have the volume buttons which allow you to skip to the next song or previous song if you hold it for three seconds and we have the power button which also allows you to pause play or with a double tab you can access Siri or Google assistant on the left ear cup we have a really cool feature that allows you to adjust how much bass you want simply slide the button up and down to increase or decrease the bass but the one thing I dont like about this is that the slider will show some scratches or wear and tear over time below the slider we have a micro USB for charging and a threeandahalf millimeter input for physical connections Skullcandy also claims up to 40 hours of battery life which is insane and probably one of the best in the market we also have an incredible quick charge feature which allows you to get three hours of playtime with just ten minutes of charging in terms of bluetooth it is just as easy to pair as any other headphones when you turn the headphones on it will automatically start to pair your device and if it doesnt automatically pair all you have to do is connect it through your Bluetooth settings on your device which takes less than 30 seconds the range is about average and I havent had any problems with it I also havent experienced any latency issues which makes these great for watching videos now lets get to the most important part of the review the sound quality I always find myself adjusting the bass with the slider button in which I think is a really unique and cool feature to have but of course the more bassy you like your music and the less crispness and clearness is going to be in the vocals what makes these headphones great in my opinion is that you have the option to listen with less bass if you like more clear audio separation with the instruments and vocals or you can listen with a ton of bass if you like to have that extra character and your music I would have liked to see some noise cancelling as well but these do keep a lot of the noise out with the sealed fit I will say though if you arent a fan of bass and you would like noise cancelling then there are some other headphones out there that do better with clear and precise vocals and audio separation I would recommend the Sony WH 1000 XM threes and the bose noisecanceling 700 s another thing I noticed is that some audio leaks out so if youre listening to music over a 60 volume then people close to you might be able to hear your music so is the Skullcandy crusher right for you well if you are looking for some headphones that are affordable have tons of base an incredible battery life the great build quality and design simple buttons and are good for traveling then I would recommend these headphones for you but like I mentioned earlier if you arent a fan of bass and would rather have that noise cancelling and clear vocals then the Sony WH 1000 Exim threes and the bose noisecanceling 700 are some of my favorite headphones and would be a great thanks so much for watching guys and if you learned anything from this video make sure to hit that

"video_id": "H2XcSUrBftc", "Closed Captions": " hello there you gorgeous person you this Christmas experts Im here with a new light but tech TVs quite the little name there theyre another pair of true wireless earbuds so many at the moment but these are the set themselves out because theyre only 99 pounds which is pretty affordable as far as these wireless earbuds go and  theyve got up to 70 hours of battery life using that battery case ten hours at a time and then you can get six full recharges using the case apparently which is better than pretty much any other buds out there that Ive tested out so Im gonna show you whats in the box and then zip forward magically in time a few days and give you my full review and more on the latest and greatest tech please do POG subscribe and ding that notifications bell Cheers so Ive never even heard of light detect before these guys got in touch so were really interested to see how the sound quality and everything mirrors up to some of the biggest rivals out there cause Samsung Galaxy buds cost a little bit more pretty much everyone is doing there or not a wireless earbuds now correct you get these damn things out the box oh my is a tight fit there we go theres the actual carry kids and then the buds themselves oh and some spare rubbery tips as well so you can change them depending on how big or small your look calls ours you can see just some different sizes there and there is the charging cable as well nice bit type see which is always good to see do like it when they use Type C these days roll in the old micro USB not Lea is it reversible also most modern phones use Type C now so I need you to have to carry around two different cables when youre heading off on a long trip and you got a QuickStart guide as well which is properly wedged in there there we go and then just shows you the parent process and everything but Im expecting it to be very straight forward indeed so these are the actual like patek TVs as you can see theyre fairly chunky wireless earbuds but nothing too extreme and of course lots of smart tech packed away in there so hopefully should prove comfortable Ill cover that in my full indepth review towards the end of this video and the actual charging case itself as well I really really like its got lovely fabric style finish quite unique similar I guess to the likes the Google buds except hopefully the light detects boards suck and of course you just stick the actual buds when theres a wrong netic connection and as you can see there the charger case already has some power in it because the buds are now charging and you just power that way and there you go youve got nice little charge and that light indicator on the outside as well obviously gears itself is quite chunky definitely thicker than the like so the Samsung Galaxy buds care stuff like that but should still just about we pocket sizes though you dont mind having a slightly unsightly bulge and of course you can attach them to stuff that using that as well so yeah and of course theyre on the Mike is your typec USB port just stick that in where the charging kit itself is running out of juice and others here they reckon youll get up to 70 hours of use from a fully charged kids in it and stuff right I mean testing out that I protect em use for a good few days now Im gonna sit flat ninety nine pound asking price pretty solid value in one feature in particular is very impressive indeed now first up I do like the dinky design of these things theyre not exactly the most revolutionary of true Wireless here buzz they look like quite a lot of rivals but they are nice and dinky as you can see there they just fit neatly into your inner ear sanctum theyre reasonably subtle little just out too far or anything and theyre pretty comfortable to wear for a good few hours at a time as well once you find the right rubbery tips to fit your ear shape they just sit in there nicely and they dont feel like that sort of passion on your inner ear or anything but as you can see theyre then nice and firmly in there theres a lot of runnin for trains in the like this week and they have never felt like theyre gonna pop out at any point the ipx7 a waterresistant as well so no problems if you get caught in a downpour great news if you live in the UK like I do and you can even drop them in your cup of herbal tea and they wont break just give a quick wiping off will be up so you find the buds work independently of one another as well either one can be the master so you can use just the left one by itself absolutely fine or just the right one by itself and if you using both you can just take one out put one back in the case the other one will continue to work seamlessly so its all good thats how I did notice that when I pulled them out the case if I didnt pull the left one out first occasionally they would struggle to work as a pair as to make sure you always take the left one out of the case before the right one and then I protect em used to actually have a little push buttons here on the flat surface right on the edge as well for sure that was comfortable to use because of course when you push the button and you are basically driving the buds into your ear holes so not only is what youll want to do is you want to solve pitch the buds and then tap like so kind of a little bit awkward but it does work and the buttons themselves are fantastic you get one on each bud just push in once either buds will pause or play your music if you double push the right one that will actually raise the volume if you double push the  one that will drop the volume back down against is great to see that they work it independently like that and of course if you want to skip the track its a triple tap of this one you want to go back a track its a triple tap of the left one its of course if you only use in walnut buds then you wont get that full functionality but its great that with just a single push button on each bud they managed to incorporate all of these different controls and when I first started tested out the light detectors I was a little bit concerned because the Bluetooth connection with my smartphone was really not very good it was constantly cutting out stammering stuttering the kids in the music would just pause for a few seconds before finally resuming thankfully just seems to have been initial jitters because after a couple of hours they were absolutely fine so that the kids are tiny little stomach when I hibernate my smartphone but otherwise no worries you got full app tanks support and everything as well for syncing up your sound with whatever video youre watching at the time thatll seems to work absolutely fine thats for the sound quality well the lovely stock TVs are pretty good for that 99 pound asking price and force the folk music does bizarre things like that theyre not entirely well suiters they dont quite have the power behind them to really make those tracks resonate as the bass is a little bit weak the drums dont really slap the way they would really hope for as you would get with something with much more expensive like the the power beats Pro for instance so the tongue is definitely better suited to something like pop music classical music things like that the clarity is really good all the instruments come through clearly voices again the vocals very really nice and clear and for 99 pounds definitely happy on top volume these things will absolutely blast your eardrums as well and the clarity is still pretty good even on those higher volumes I tend to keep it around the mid volume range and I found that with the properly fitting rubber tips then all these cancellation was actually pretty good as well have any active noise cancellation or anything like that they do a really good job of blocking out surround and sound from the even when I was on a tree and on a tube somewhere really noisy didnt have to boost the volume up at all but the area where the levee stocked heavies really impressed is the battery life frankly the battery performers on these things is really good now i protect reckons you get around 10 hours of use from a single charge in that case and I was like yeah show me Ill have whatever pills youve been popping no chance where they last a full 10 hours but actually after 90 minutes I checked the Bluetooth battery power written on my smart phone there was still at 90 was like this is same could they actually go beyond the ten hour limit they didnt quite manage to break ten hours but they came really really close thats about double what you get from most rival true wireless earbuds some very very strong indeed and when they do need a recharge just shove them back in the handy carry case and apparently youll get up to six full recharges out of this case as well Ive been rocking it for a good few days now and Im not even close to wearing this thing out so it definitely seems to do the job theyre pretty faster charging as well just fifteen minutes and theyll give you a couple of hours of use and that is why I think of the line protect every is after a full week of testing as you see not quite perfect but for 99 pounds they have a lot to offer including that really impressive battery life thats definitely the best battery life of any true wireless earbuds that Ive personally tested but that said I did get an email just this morning from creative about then you only gold true wireless earbuds apparently forced 14 hours of battery life on a single charge so Ill be getting those into a review those and see how they stack up against the light protector about the same price as well around that sub 100 pound mark so Ill be very interested in indeed let me know what you think in the comments down below if youve got your own personal preferred brand of true wireless earbuds as well which you really really endorse especially on that one 100 pound walk be definitely be great to hear your thoughts in the comments down below as well and one of the latest greatest tech please do pod subscribe editing that notification spell Cheers Music", "video_title": "Lypertek Tevi Review

Lypertek Tevi true wireless headphones the best buds Ive tested for battery life A full charge gives you just under ten hours of music playback while the charging case can power the Tevis up several times over\n\nWith a UK price of 99 these are definitely among my favourite Bluetooth earbuds that cost under 100 Theyre compact and light enough to comfortably wear for a few hours at a time while the snug secure fit means the Lypertek Tevi buds are suitable for jogging Theyre IPX7 water resistant as well so you can rock them out in the rain\n\nFor audio quality theyre solid for the price I find Samsungs Galaxy Buds are better for rock and dance with stronger lows but these Bluetooth true wireless headphones offer impressive clarity powerful volume and respectable passive noise cancelling And for battery life the Tevi earbuds really are the best Ive reviewed  although Creatives Outlier Gold promises 14 hours from a single charge Check back soon for my full verdict on those",

102247365281", "video_id": "aL9tq9qaZC0", "Closed Captions": " Music hey guys Patrick here and today Ive got an awesome unboxing for you this just arrived from Logitech and it is not released in Australia for about another couple of days I think Im pretty sure you can preorder it at ple right now or your local PC gaming shop gogo  JB guys they are the price levitate gear normal process are at places like ple or msy so check those guys out this is the g5 33 wireless headphones that have just come out in Australia I know theyve been around in America for a while I know there was reviews out there I know but this is Australia my friend so Im gonna box this now and hopefully well in a week or so Ill have a review for you guys because I really want to use it because I have the first ones that came out the G 933 and I am in love with these headphones I use it so much so that I got rid of my speakers which were Logitech speakers because these headphones were so much better so this to me I feel like is the sort of the baby brother of for example the Jean 900 here at the G 344 channel was is now the baby brother I suppose and I feel but this is just a step down with a little bit less features maybe and little bit less flakiness I dont know to be still I wouldnt travel with these for example but lets see whats inside the box and Ill get you a full review but from the outside my friends very nice box matte back and weve got here 71 cinematic gaming with pro G or your drivers weve got 1515 freedom for 15 hours to 15 meters 50 now is that sounds pretty damn good I know these guys get about eight but they also have a few more extra lights on the sides but 15 hours sounds excellent it could even be better top sports mesh ear cups I dont know what you can say about sports things and gaming gear supposed to be better I dont know I want to check it out how they feel different to the g9 three threes these dont feel a bit soft and a plushy kind of feels like cheap plush inside to be honest it hasnt bothered me because theyre so large they go over in a cup my ears but Im wondering how these ones will go and if theyre the same I will definitely point it out but lets so lets open the box quickly and see whats inside my little trusty knife or there we go what else is on the side I guess a little bit of writing a little bit technical details big g53 bit technical details theyre just going to sound good who cares what kind of Drive check out right yes its a simpler box than the other on the other one big hump with the applies baguette at the box but this one I think it will be a nice simple box empty box and we have the wireless receiver of course in some sort of very tight plastic I havent really seen something like that before well its like guys come on like also protecting or as a petition from Team oh oh okay still pieces of it left well not the most exciting unboxing there all right thats that and weve got the arm oh the headphones some instructions and the cable thats it just like the other mouse that we unboxed before not much inside set the cable seems like a decent length I think you can use this while actually game so yes full rubber has got no sort of material on it no sheathing your cover but seems like a good quality USB cable and you know sometimes these are hard to come by so you know take it with what it is ah one feature that I can already see that is missing that the other one has is multiple sources so this one does not have a jack in it that you can put a laptop on the side into your wireless receiver and get an extra sound in there so that is one difference but I can already notice things start and lets get in I see the actual headphones or category very nice very nice indeed okay okay it feels a little bit different but it could just be that theyre new and the foreign feels very very similar if I would say almost the same before me I dont know Im being so picky mmm and the sides fingerprints Im going to get on it easily shiny Ive got a button some cool oh I like that its pretty loose thats pretty cool onoff button and charge it up in a minute and weve got the microphone here and it does extend I dont particularly like this extension as photos do you need it it becomes very wavy and dunno it holds very well so I dont know but look I mean look at that this is very loose I will see well see what happened about both and youll see how comfortable it is to put on well guys it is a lot lighter than the G 933 and that is the first and best thing I can notice right out its so much lighter hole my goodness and it feels very very comfortable it is definitely cutting my ears and now Im getting excited to use it for a long gaming session wow this could actually be good this doesnt hide out thats one any kind of users headphones going to sticks out a little bit I suppose it to know that if youre into that charging port on a button and a G button and that is it Im ecstatic it looks pretty good to me keen to and excited to see what its about and Ill get a review thing I soon so were not before buying lets just see if its actually worth one hundred and sixtynine dollars being into the tides right now on preorder thank you very much guys for watching and Ill catch you later now remember to check out that competition Ive got going it is ending at the end of this month so get your common sense and subscribe it thats the way youre going to get in the drawer Ill catch you later thank you so much Music", "video_title": "Logitech G533 Wireless Headphones Unboxing  Tech Man Pat",

RS 170 bison Heiser the difference between the RS 170 and the RS 180 is these are closed and the other ones are open so many of these are open I chose to do the 170s because I play games and whenever I watch films I dont want the person next day and hear me nor do I want to hear them with open headphones you hear everybody and everybody can hear whatever gunshots music whatever it is pretty clearly to the person next to you really distracting if youre on planes is not like you hear the noise the person next to you can hear you or if you know lets say the searchers trying to study and they have listened to everything going on your headset can be very distracting so one 7yz it was these are the wireless radio frequency from what I gather theyre at 24 gigahertz to 24 8 gigahertz thats the signal range so if youve got a cell phone a cell phone but like if youre one of those people who still have the landline with a broadcasting signal up like 24 then they could cause interference so obviously try to find things that arent on the same frequency a little bit about the Box obviously you can see into it sorry for the being really really oversaturated but comes in a standard plastic blister bag pop this open coming out pretty easy maybe take some scissors to cut whatever tape they put on to it but else why I was pretty frustration free not a big deal I got mine from Amazon also comes with a 2 year warranty which is pretty nice so that way you know if you break it or something else to it you can always do something about it so which is nice so anyway the next thing were going to talk about is kind of inside of it other than the headset but you get obviously a nice light box inside the light box comes with a instruction manual and the CD havent had to use the CD and this assuming that has to do with some extra options but it gave a sound card or builtin sound probably already has options to deal with that Danielle warning Im not sure what the warning is for maybe if you play your headphones too loud but I guess its got to be included the same way that they include dont operate heavy machinery on childrens medication inside is the other little box comes with cable to connect it a little anti kink thing drive it a bunch of different connectors so that way if you live in a different part of the world it works for you I assume its just a global standard cover all if you buy it in some other portion its good to go so on the actual product itself its again its got a giant radio frequency tower and the headphones themselves sitting on top of it there you go you just set it down and it it goes now the nice thing is is that lets you literally just set it down on top of it and it starts charging I dont think it really matters which way you even put it as long as its sitting on there and making contact the contacts themselves are on the front there and on the back here right there sit on top Im good to go on the front of the charging dock station has whether or not its charging the base is the doubleup base basically doubles your base makes it a lot more pronounced your surround option which is pretty cool especially for gaming it sometimes calls warbling we need to some sounds something like that thats the best way I can put it but thats generally if its not good code interest around I personally like surround so it works good for me back to the actual docking station itself is the jack that you can plug into just about anything your CD player your TV your computer or sound card or backing about motherboard here is your it has an attenuator it goes eight decibels to zero decibels I put my zero an eight a little quiet and obviously your power supply goes into the wall pretty standard bugs in there hit the power button in the front and off you go so a little bit about the headphones themselves sound quality wise they remind me of the HD to 80s theyre pretty good responsiveness theyre pretty fast sound great theyre really soft theyre super light that was the other thing that was really surprised by a lot of wireless headsets I have the World of Warcraft as well and tons of others as you can see I reviewed before these light its pretty impressive theyre built pretty pretty solid theyre not too stiff on the head they block out a lot of sound one thing that kind of sound like 280 they remind me of 100 autocrat headphones theyre about 170 on Amazon right now thats where I generally get most of my stuff so its pretty good that way youve got a good sound and its 100 per headset and its wireless and its better than any gaming wireless headset sound youre basically gonna find however is not without its faults a couple things if you use Ventrilo or stings go silent for a little while on skype but we says anything youll have a little bit of time where you say something in a goes like a very very low of noise but it doesnt lose it so like I could hear everything but right before that sound pitches in it kicks back on and kicks back off can be kind of annoying if do the thing bothers you but it doesnt actually cut out the persons voice oh its not so bad obviously it lengthens and yadda so once again this radio frequency as far as cutting out some people complaining that they have a lot of cutting out maybe theyre getting cross interference I only have a cell phone in this house and a microwave so I dont have anything that really interferes per se so I always take that in consideration if you have a wireless mouse a wireless keyboard cell phones a house thats running on like the same frequency 24 gigahertz youre gonna get some crosstalk youre gonna lose it I dont have any of the issues that some people have Ive been able to walk most of the me into my house into the next room start to get a little kept it loose a little fuzzy sometimes itll just cut straight out but its pretty good most of time you can listen to it walk all right around the house and its usually fairly good once you radiofrequency look out for that you can go you dont have to be in line of sight you can put it off to the side but honestly wherever you put it put it close enough that it can talk back so once again this is the review on the RS 170 s once again the only difference between these and the Rs 180s is these are the closed ones meaning that they block out sound they dont have as wide and listening field doesnt feel as natural but still blocks up sounds they sound great they remind me of to 80s but without a cord itll be a great purchase for you if youd like to be able to get up and walk away or if youd like to pair a great set of headphones wirelessly and have your mic on your desk for instance I have you prefer using really nice mics as opposed to move Mike coming off with a cheap pair headset anyway once again this is the rs1 70s and my style has subscribe to me if you have any questions or have dicta the headset you would like me to look at let me go Thanks", "video_title":

or if you have Amazon fire TV built into your TV that works as well I want to show you what headphones to get to give you the best TV watching experience were going to be using the Kohen headphones because it has the latest bluetooth version 50 which gives you extra battery life longer range and faster data transfer it also has builtin aptX low audio latency so you dont have any audiovideo sync problems it also has active noise cancellation my AC unit sounds like a freight train you can hear it right now very loud very annoying but when I flick that switch it blocks out majority of that noise which is great theres no audio leakage coming out of these headphones unlike the beats solo which sit on your ear you have a lot of audio leakage in a person sitting next to you might hear that audio this its around your ear very soft cushions and will block out most of that sound so the person sitting next to you wont most likely hear the audio coming from your headphones I Technic or a little less expensive both of these headphones are under 100 but the eye technic is around 55 dollars and Ill leave links in the video description below if you guys are interested in these headphones both are Bluetooth version 50 which is very important when connecting to the amazon firetv stick or whatever headphones you get make sure they have Bluetooth version 50 so I technic headphones have very similar features it has the builtin noise active noise cancellation where blocks out the AC unit in the background just flick that switch the battery life on the I Technic headphones are around 20 hours on the Kohen headphones the battery life is around 30 hours but theyre more expensive these also sit around your ear so you have very little audio leakage coming out of the headphones so you dont bother your loved one while theyre sleeping and both of these headphones connect to your phone and you can take calls and has a builtin microphone so you can talk in them as well and I technic of course has the same cables to microUSB cable and the audio the audio cable into your headphone jack the settings you want to go over to Bluetooth devices now if you want to connect your headphones to your TV were not using the Amazon fire TV stick thats a different video Ill leave a link in the video description below how to do that that way you can actually connect to headphones at the same time but your audio latency is going to be a little bit greater because youre connecting to headphones which causes more data transfer now Im gonna leave a link in the video description below if youre interested in connecting to headphones at the same time to your TV whether youre using Amazon fire TV stick or a cable box it doesnt matter you just need a headphone jack on your TV or audio output on your TV on your Bluetooth devices and Im gonna go down to other Bluetooth devices first connect the mic Technic headphones its very easy to do the controls are on the bottom and you just press and hold the power button which is also pause and play button and then wait until the LED turns red and blue Bluetooth and searching right now and picked up my tube and here it is you actually connected the echo show but were not going to do that that was a different video I made my Technic hit select and now its pairing all right so now it is connected its extremely loud the bass on these are amazing I love it let me turn up these lights Music were gonna add Bluetooth device similar controls to the eye technic and your press and hold the power button for a couple seconds maybe five seconds until the LED turned red and blue so the LED is turning red and blue pairing device headset connected now these also have great base active noise cancellation is great blocks out the AC unit so if youre watching TV and your wife is ready to go to bed you could grab your headset turn it on and then switch from the TV volume to your headphones should Auto connect within a few seconds and it does

want to watch this video oh and by the way theyre 55 this is he became an tech reviews and today were gonna take a look at the sole ultra wireless headphones lets check them out now in this video were gonna do an unboxing review of the SOL ultra wireless headphones so lets get right to it make sure you hit the subscribe button and tap the little bell icon to get notified when new videos become available now before doing their boxing lets check Sol electronics website so you can see more about the specs so were looking at a weight of 197 grams so these are gonna be relatively light youre looking at bluetooth 50 a three hundred and twenty milliamp hour battery forty millimeter speakers and then 33 foot blue to the range also you do have the ability to take phone calls with these so you have answer pause and and phone call buttons as well as all the expected Bluetooth profiles now 36 hours of battery life is what really excites me about this headphone and then also the audio quality so lets get right to those two points now inside the box youre gonna find your headphones a travel back as well as a microUSB charging cable now taking a closer look at the headphones what youll see is that you have memory foam on the top memory foam for each earpiece and they are foldable so you can fold them right they have the sole logo on the side see it appears on both sides and then what you have here at the very bottom is you have a micro USB charging cable port pinhole mic headphone you know us standard headphone jack you have your LED indicating that its on power button and then you can see that you have here your multifunction button as well as your volume rockers now the headphones themselves are pretty straightforward and you can notice that well try to put this in an angle there is a right and left ear cup and lets see if we can show that right there so you can see the right logo and the left logo is there and as we put these on youll notice that they do a really nice job of covering and even when playing music one of the things Ill mention about these is that theres there isnt really much perceived sound leakage coming out of the remember these are 6555 dollars depending on when you look at this video they feel well they dont feel like theyre cramping or you know vice in your head and let me turn over to the right here over to the left you can see what that looks like and you know they feel fine on your ear there is no real heat that builds up around your I would say your ears and then also theres no heat buildup that I found at the very top so theyre very comfortable to wear I think a lot of this has to do with the lightweight nature of these headphones as we take a look at the audio side of these they do fantastically well for again this price point basemans and highs are all present but bass is where its at these have great bass so I listened to several tracks I look at for testing music I look at my track start with audio vocals first and then we introduce the instruments and sometimes even introduce the bass and what I look for is will the bass when it comes in does it overwhelm the vocals or when more than one voice comes in does the other voice thats coming in overwhelmed the vocals as well am I able to hear all the instruments so these had great soundstage for again for this price point had great bass mids highs are present but not as bright as you find in some other headphones but again well balanced now when the bass was introduced one of the things that really impressed me about these is that typically the bass overwhelms all the of their voices or even the instruments that was not the case with this and Ill tell you like the bass is like thumping bass so it does a really nice job there so if youre looking for you know headphones that have great bass but dont overwhelm you know the senses when it comes to your mids and your highs and these are definitely a great deal so guys that wraps up our review of the sole ultra wireless headphones these are a great value have great audio have fantastic battery life and its something that I highly recommend so go ahead and check them out",

"video_id": "QJhEmWdZ7_Y", "Closed Captions": " if I were to say the word Montblanc to you what would come to mind probably something in forms of luxury like fashion pens and of course watches but now what if we add to that a pair of high quality headphones its Joshua Vergara whats going on everybody heres a look at a couple of new products from Mont Blanc including an update to the Mont Blanc summit  yep were starting off with the mum block summit  plus and this new SmartWatch from the luxury brand brings some needed updates to the wear OS device what we have here is now the Snapdragon wire 3100 processor that comes with its 1 gigabytes of RAM and 8 gigabytes of onboard storage its of course a Bluetooth connected watch but it also has the ability to connect to phone networks LTE connectivity is available along with calls using the speaker and the microphone built in that battery is a 440 million power battery that will allow for up to three to five days worth of battery life if you turn off key SmartWatch functions but you might want to stay in the main SmartWatch operating system because Mont Blanc is offering a lot in their version of where LS you navigate around it using of course the touch screen but there are a couple of pushers for shortcuts and then you can do a rotating crown which is honestly something that I feel like should be on every SmartWatch moving forward especially where OS devices and this entire casing which comes in at forty three point five millimeters is made of pure steel and is going to be ipx8 rated this luxury SmartWatch does have a number of different configurations that you can put together in order to get a nice combo that fits your style including over a thousand different watch face combinations using the watch face configurator and then you can also put a bunch of different straps on to there as there are plenty of them that I even saw during my short time with it but with all of the different sensors that are built into the summit  plus there are actually extra applications to take advantage of their capabilities and help you in different ways for both travel and fitness and wellbeing I wasnt really able to show too many of these applications but there are different apps like a travel info app that will give you your local traveler information when youre on the go theres even another app that will help you minimize jet lag in the timeshifter app which will use the information of your upcoming flight details and your current sleep patterns in order to help you that jet lag while youre in a different destination as far as fitness features are concerned this watch is also able to do vo2 max tracking as well as heart rate variability two things that along with heart rate tracking in general are slightly more advanced things to track when it comes to your workouts with all of its capabilities its great to see that Montblanc is trying to add in features on top of the fact that their highend watches are of course going to come in at a higher price tag so its not just for the look its also for the different capabilities that a watch like this can provide and that will include everything from making calls to having LTE connectivity to all of the tools that are in this wire OS device and all in all its just a greatlooking watch and thats something that you kind of expect from a luxury brand like Mont Blanc but its one thing that you might not expect is a pair of headphones from a company like this thats right mom Blanc is creating a pair of travel headphones that have some of the DNA of Mont Blanc luxury design all the way down to some metal and steel but also a lot of comfort in the headband and the ear cups themselves I was able to use the Mont Blanc wireless over ear headphones for a little while and I was able to listen to a number of different tracks coming from my own smartphone and I have to say the sound is actually pretty up there when it comes to just pure quality but then the comfort of the actual headphones themselves are what really got me there are a few features that come in really handy if youre an avid traveler not only do you want to have comfort when these are sitting around your neck or up on your head while youre doing the long haul flights and listening to anything that might be coming through those headphones but you also want them to pack down pretty easily so they dont take up too much space in your luggage both are actually covered by Mont Blanc thanks to a combination of leather and of those metal finishes obviously none of the metal will actually touch you when youre wearing the headphones on your head or around your neck so all of the pieces that do touch your skin are really comfortable thats because the leather is also filled with some sort of memory foam which are not only comfortable to the touch but also make enough of a seal so that you are immersed into your audio there are some simple controls not only on the touch sensitive area but also with a couple of buttons that are found on the outer portions of the ear cups including ports for USB C connectivity and charging and also for a headphone jack cable so that you can connect it via an analog connection if you need to even a dedicated button for triggering google assistant but of course what makes these a little bit more highend in terms of travel headphones is the added active noise cancellation and while there is somewhat stiffer competition these days for anc quality headphones I believe the mum Blancs are going to be pretty close to the categories of the Sonys and the bows of the world I would have to compare them sidebyside of course but I will say that in the little bit of time that I was using them the ANC did enough to block out the majority of what was going on around me I even found myself just having them on while filming the watch and just enjoying my media from my phone with the ANC awning getting into the zone filming the rest of this video now just like with the Smart Watch I dont have the actual price of these headphones I do expect them to be on the higher end after all Montblanc is a luxury brand I got to say I was really surprised when these headphones were revealed to me at my meeting and Im actually very impressed that this first attempt by mam Blanca yielded such a memorable experience I do hope to review these products for you very soon so keep it tuned to my channel and subscribe to it if you havent already drop some likes on this video if you like what Im doing here and also again to the comment sections and let me know what you think about any of the mam Blanc products I talked about in this piece let me know if you have any mont blanc products yourself whether they are where OS smartwatches they have a few of them already or any of their other luxury items let me know what your experience has been with them in the comments down below as well and with all of that said Im gonna go ahead and call it on this one thank you so much for watching look forward to even more here on my channel and until my next video I would just remind you to enjoy your tea

"9fShPZdMqs", "Closed Captions": " hello just peeps this is Chris from Tex bird and Im here with the new its our Wireless sports headphones up from jbird hopefully pretty much all the information you need is right there in the title they are fully wireless Bluetooth earphones and they are designed for the more active lifestyle so if you like jump in between rocks in your spare time you know so its gonna cost you 90 quid theyll be available online from October the 9th and in stores from October 15th Im just gonna get them fully unbox set them all up using the gia bird mobile app and test them out as well to see if theyre actually up to snuff and for more reviews on the latest headphones earphones stuff like that dont forget to hit subscribe and thing that notifications bell Cheers so lets just break into this packaging and the grand and veil there are that our Wireless bought headphones accessories inside yep thats very helpful obviously need all the usual stuff to power them back up because they are of course bluetooth and then behind all that you also get a rather meaty Quick Start Guide Wow look at the size of that its like worn freaking peace so the actual headphones themselves well just stick those aside for a moment and have a full explore them in a second so you also get a proprietary charging dock as well so you need to do is connect to the tower to the dock like so just push it in there nice and firm once thats connected then you just basically plug in the USB bit either into a laptop a USB adapter whatever you have lying around and that should power back up again full charge should take about six hours but partly you can also get a full hours of use from just ten minutes of charge times are pretty handy if you forget to plug them in before pounding the pavement that is actually connected pretty damn tight as well so they certainly shouldnt slip off by accident or anything its not magnetic connection unfortunately it is basically just clips in there and thats thats held tight at least so thats the main thing as you can see there the towers do of course bought a soft silicone in earbud and you actually get a spare set right here in the box as well so no matter what your ear size and ship you can get a different set connected and hopefully provide a nice comfortable fit they snap off nice and easy just basically give them a bit of a tug off they come as you can see there the inner bits exposed then all you need to do is find another one and snap it on there theres a nice little sticky a bit to help keep it in place so just slip that over there and that will hold it nice and firm as you can see there the cord can actually be adjusted on the flight as well so you can make it shorter longer whatever you fancy to get a nice comfortable fit you also get a bit of clip action as well if you just want to clip it to your clothing just to make sure its not flying about the place I just slips onto the cable like so and then youre basically good to go as you see there youve got a little control panel actually attached to the tower wireless spot headphones as well so youve got control over the volume you can also pause and play your media and apparently can be used to answer calls and theres also a full support for Google assistant in there too designs pretty straightforward by the looks of it nor particular frills or anything like that its all about obviously the comfort the fact that is a fully water resistant as well its ipx7 so you can give them a full on Duncan in some water you actually wear them while youre swimming if you want to and its pretty sweat resistant as well good news if you were you sweat up a storm like I do with any amount of activity you can grab it in black and gray or blue and it certainly so far just from an initial test seems pretty durable that nice flexi rubber cable shouldnt get all tied up or twisted or anything like that and hopefully should be able to take a good bit of punishment as well now as mentioned there is actually a gia boat app available to sync up with your headphones as well and thats available for either iOS or Android first up we just need to actually pair them a to the smartphone of course thats dive into the bluetooth effort and then if we hold down the power button here on the gia bird taras there we go weve got a little light flashing on as you can see it just pops straight up in the devices and then pair and complete nice and easy thats what we like dive on back into the gia bird app you can see its busy connecting now to our Terras connected hooray I like it when stuff just works so what this allows you to do is basically customize the audio output from the G over terras all the ways you can choose from various presets as well if youre feeling a bit more lazy diving on into the music section it looks like you can actually stream some tunes island beats cardio live hypernym of course you can you just use your standard Spotify playlists if youd rather do that you could also share your presets and everything or with the world if you want to and then you can check out a little bit more about your headphones as you see there theres also a fine my buds option as well so lets turn that on and then this will actually show you where your buds are currently looking at it presumably only if theyre actually turned on and everything of course all right so Ive been using gia birds for a couple of days now full on use and so far definitely liking them the silicone gels provide a nice comfortable fit the fact youve got different sizes as well means you can find the ones that are just right for your lug holes and then when you slip them in there its getting nice and easy to slide straight in its a nice snug fit so you can be a running pounding the pavement as fast as you like and they will stay in there theres no sign of slippage or anything even when youre getting a wee bit sweaty I have found however that because youve got this control block here over on the right hand side they do contendere get dragged over to the right a bit as you are moving around which kind of tugs a little bit on your left earlobe and its particularly annoying if youre trying to then look over your right shoulder it just then pause a little bit and provides a bit of resistance not to the point where Ill ever risk popping out or anything just its just kind of a little bit irritating so definitely recommend using the bundled clip which I showed you earlier just clip it onto the back of your collar if possible and thatll just help to prevent that from happening and Ive got to admit I did miss the magnetic connection of the Wampus but as well especially handy when youre not using them these things we can just slip off quite easily whereas the one place you just stick them together like that they magnetically connect and I see forms are kind of weird necklace no problem with it slipping off at all those controls work absolutely fine theyre nice and easy to locate and youve got usual volume controls and nice and intuitive volume up at the top volume down down below you can also skip tracks as well a few long press them so thats pretty handy if youre doing a bit of a play list some it comes on you dont really feel in the mood for as for the battery life I have found that between five and six hours of use per full charge is basically spoton they give you a little update of roughly how much battery life is remaining when you turn them on you do actually get a proper precise readout of exactly how much about your life it is remain and within that jaybird app which is definitely very handy and as promised you can pile them up pretty quickly as well just ten minutes of the plug and you will get a full hour of use out of them no problems and good news if you can just kind of on a quick jog and session and you forgot to charge them as for the sound quality I see the towers are pretty respectable in that front as well probably quite similar I guess to the oneplus bullets vocals come across nice and crisp and its only the sort of heavier rock tracks things like that where things get a little bit muddled especially on higher volume but in terms of the volume as well absolutely no problem theyre strong powerful output when you bump them right up thats a good news if youre a wee bit deaf like me and that in a nutshell is the dear bird Tara wireless sports buds definitely do the job for anyone who does a lot of runnin hits the gym quite frequently and just want something to listen to their tracks for decent quality its nightly quid not the cheapest as well you cant get the lights the oneplus Wireless buds for cheaper than that so definitely let us know what

within the next five to ten minutes Im going to help you decide whether the Edifier w 830 bt wireless headphones are worth buying now first of all before I show you the actual product I really like the packaging on this one very understated packaging I come from a graphic design background and I love the fact that this box is matte and then theyve done this like gloss varnish just to the headphones on the box simple thing but I just really like it the box also details some of the features on these headphones including up to 60 days of standby time and up to 95 hours of music playback from a single charge that is pretty impressive now before I show you the headphones and talk to you about the quality just want to let you know that this is a live broadcast so if you do want to use the live chat then please do if you want to use the super chat that will highlight your comment and if youre watching this after the live broadcast please do leave me some comments or questions down below answer pretty much all of them and if you can subscribe to the geeky noise channel Id really appreciate it hit that subscription button and also click on the notification bill because then youll be notified when I either do a live broadcast or when I upload one of my regular videos so anyway what else do we get inside the box where we get the headphones themselves which are supplied inside this really nice pouch you also get a USB charging cable you also get a threeandahalf millimeter audio cable as well you can use these wired as well as Wireless now theyre made some bold claims about battery life and Ill talk to you about that a little bit later on but lets take a look inside this pouch its like a zip pouch very very nice its got Earths or rigid top and bottom to it and then in this top section weve got a little netting sort of pocket to keep your cables in and then the bottom section obviously houses the headphones themselves and when you take these out I think theyre really nice or understated sort of look very very nice indeed a combination of blacks and then around on the ear cups here we got this sort of gunmetal grey type color very very nice coloring to these I do like it a lot lets talk about comfort factor first of all nice padding across the headband weve got some Eddy fire branding across here as well and then on the actual ear cups and these do fold flat lets go into the case which is really nice but on these a really nice amount of padding on here as well Im pretty sure dont quote me on this it it feels like memory foam but just a really nice amount of padding and a nicer sort of layer of material over the top as well dont think this is leather I think it sort of ass or an artificial type material but a really nice quality of padding very very comfy and theyre quite a nice lightweight pair of headphones so I dont think you have any problem at all wearing these for prolonged periods of time weve also got adjustment on the size sides with this ratchet mechanism and wearing them theyre sort of over ear design but not massive theyre just the right size for my ears and they feel very very comfortable I really do think they feel nice and comfy now if we look at the actual controls on the ear cups lets fold this round so we can get a better look so on this one here weve got the threeandahalf millimeter audio jack and weve also got an NFC contact point on this ear cup as well so that means you can connect them nice and easily if your smartphones got NFC weve also got a little rubber cover and underneath that rubber cover is the micro USB charging point now this is the only negative I found with these so far this seemed this little rubber cover comes out sometimes a time its a little bit loose I would have liked it with to being a bit sort of a tighter fit if you push it down in there you can get it to sort of stay in but thats just one of those very very minor things I picked up on then on this one here weve got a little tiny pinhole microphone weve also got a little push button in the middle which is like a multifunction button and then volume up and down so youve got full control on this earcup here so if a call comes in you can obviously take that call and then your music will resume after youve stopped speaking adjustment wise weve obviously got some rotation on this axis weve also got the ear cups moving on this axis means you get a nice comfortable fit charging very very good as well very not quick charge but a very good charging time and the claims of up to I think 60 days is it yeah up to sixty days standby well I cant comment on that cuz I havent had them sixty days but going back on the claim of up to 95 hours of playback time Ive had roughly I would say about forty to fifty hours of use and still havent had to charge them which is good by itself I mean come on that is absolutely fantastic I dont think youll have any issue at all with battery life on these and if they live up to this 95 hours of music playback time which are pretty sure they will go in judging on it so far then thats gotta be one of the best performance battery life in a pair of headphones Ive tested to date now we talk about the actual audio quality in a very short while before I do so let me just remind you that you can also find me on Twitter on Facebook and on Instagram if you search geek annoyed on all of those platforms you can find me please do follow along especially on Twitter I tweet a lot so follow me on Twitter as well Ive also got the at geek discounts account on Twitter so if youre into buying technology and you want to save a little bit then please do check out that Twitter as well so back to the Edifier headphones the w8 30 BT part from the really good battery life apart from the comfort factor how do they sound thats very very important bass extension on these very good I think the frequency response is 20 Hertz to 20000 Hertz so very very good bass frequencies not the lowest of bass frequencies all the most controlled lower frequencies Ive heard in a pair of headphones very very bass heavy tracks sometimes sound a little sort of mushy little bits all compressed but not too bad at all a very good performance especially at this price point which are come on through in a short while midrange vocals sound nice and natural little tiny bit of colorization these have got their own sort characteristics but again a very convincing sort of vocal performance in all different genres of music and the higher frequencies I dont think you have any complaint about at all they dont sound clinical at all just nice amount of detail dont sound tinny and they just sound really nice very very nice with the higher frequencies and the overall sound signature is very pleasing and when I looked at the price of these I was amazed excuse me very very impressed with the price check out the current price and I dont normally mention pricing in my videos because it changes so often but if you check out the links down in the video description then youll find the current pricing to these theres also a link to the Edifier website so if you want a decent pair of wireless headphones

probably going to be talking about the drop thx pandas now this is a pair of bluetooth headphones that is a collaboration between drop and thx which to me looks like a modern wireless version of the Oppo PM threes they have some pretty impressive technology Im gonna do this video a little bit differently because I really want to talk about what is making me gravitate towards using these why I keep picking these up over some of my other headphones and why I think these are pretty special at 400 bucks now first off 400 is a lot of money but if you consider the technology thats in these because these do have plane are driven drivers theyre using a Qualcomm 5124 chip which allows for apdex l DAC apdex adaptive apdex HD AACSB c pretty much all of the highend bluetooth codecs you could possibly think of these are capable playing this is a prerelease version so this one is actually handmade although the official release version is going to be you know factory made so you know take that with a grain of salt considering I dont know how that quality is gonna hold up compared to these which Im sure somebody paid very specific details to making sure everything was right but I think this is an excellent pair of headphones Ive enjoyed the hell out of using them and Ive been excited to be able to tell you guys about them but I couldnt talk about them until today because today is the day that they start preordering these which all of that information will be in the description below so first off what are these headphones well this again is a collaboration between drop and thx which thx is a company you usually associate with movies because George Lucas came out with this to bring out better detail in the audio because he felt like things were missing in Star Wars he had subtle sounds that when its projected in the theater he felt like that just wasnt being brought out so thx was designed to be able to bring out those details focus a lot more on audio and so these have a thx triplea amplifier built in so one of the first things that I noticed when I got the box is the packagings pretty simple like theres no logos I mean other than its saying drop in thx on the outside of the box then when you slide that open its just a simple spiral design theres no information theres no details its just a plain box with a plain looking pair of headphones inside so theres nothing to get excited about just simply by looking at these now you can tell inside the box theres a slot where there would normally be instructions mine didnt come with any it just came with the headphone case which is a fairly large case but its a nice hard case but it also has a compartment inside that houses the headphone cable because you are able to use these wired now I will say if youre going to use these wired I highly recommend plugging these into an amp because that really is the best way to get the most out of these so the headphones themselves are pretty plain Jane it dont look like anything special its just solid black theres not a lot of controls theres no fancy touch controls in fact the way that they did the controls on these I liked a lot theyre basically using this little joystick on the back theres only one button so that one button allows you to play pause skip your track forward go backwards turn the volume up turn the volume down everything is right there on that one button and I love the sound effect that it has when the headphones turn on and when they shut off it really reminds me of like an 80s arcade machine so having that little nostalgia just by turning these things on it just sounds really cool now the headphones himself the first thing I noticed was the headband does not have a lot of padding now the headphones are not necessarily lightweight so I thought that maybe this was going to be an issue but the silicone van that they used underneath provided plenty of padding this was a pair I was able to wear for a long period of time I guess the weight was just distributed evenly and it never got uncomfortable now the top of the headband is plastic and for me it would be something to baby be slightly concerned about just because build quality wise whenever I see plastic on a headband especially a pair that Im gonna spend 400 on I would be worried that this might snap now the way that you adjust these the aluminum thats down here just simply slides into the headband and it wraps down to connect to the headphones now the ear on the outside of the ear cups these are also plastic but without these having so many parts on the outside and without these having the ability to fold inward theres not a whole lot of parts that you have to worry about now as far as swiveling they do swivel inwards so that if you have them and you take them off your head you can swivel them down and they will lay right there instead of just sticking straight up the ear cups on these our foam ear cups wrapped in a protein leather now these are extremely soft theres a lot of give to these and the ear cups are fairly deep so my ears are not hitting the inside of the ear cups which is where you can see your left and right or marked the drivers that are in here are unique I havent seen these in a lot of other headphones you dont really see a lot of playing our ribbon drivers so I was very curious to how well that thx amplifier is gonna be able to amplify them and I can say that these get plenty loud and I never heard any distortion which was really impressive considering that was just on Bluetooth as far as your inputs go its pretty simple on the left hand side you do have your threeandahalf millimeter input for that headphone cable on the right hand side you have the USB C input for charging battery life on these youre going to get around 30 hours on a single charge but if you do happen to pick them up and theyre dead a quick 10 minute charge is going to get you three hours of use now that comes in handy because Im one of those thats the worse for making sure that all of my headphones are charged so you know being able to pick them up charge them for ten minutes and get three hours of use is always welcomed now as far as the microphones on here it says that it has dual microphones all the microphones that I see are on the right hand side but I see slots for three so Im not sure really if thats just kind of messing around with placement or how that works but I will still give you guys a sample of the mic test so that you can be a judge here alright guys so here is a test of the microphones on the drop pandas this is just to give you an idea of what it would sound if you were to take a call now lets get over to the sound because for 400 even though I think thats very inexpensive for this type of technology in these type of drivers in a Bluetooth pair of headphones 400 is still a lot of money for a lot of people and the initial thing is people are gonna want to you know compare these to the Bose 700 or the Sony 1000 XM 3s and Im here to say you probably shouldnt because this is not that kind of headphone these do not have noise canceling technology at all which I feel like with the Sony and the Bose whenever you switch over to noise cancelling you can tell that that technology is doing something to the audio like its altering it its changing it it usually warms it up a little bit or adds a little bit more thump in the bass where with these youre going to get the same sound on Bluetooth at all times like it doesnt matter theres no EQ settings which I really would have liked to have seen and Ill explain that a little bit more in a second because this overall is a very warm sounding pair of headphones I felt like the detail and the mids and the highs were extremely great I think these are very detailed but something about the bass not having that overpowering boom or punch to them just kind of added a warm layer to it now Im not saying that these dont have bass at all they have plenty of bass and plenty of thump to them but its not overpowering like a lot of bluetooth headphones are so that was one of my concerns when I saw that it had amplification at all I felt that these were gonna be very boosted I was a little concerned that there was gonna be distortion and you know simply put that just didnt happen now Im not saying that these sound like a studio pair of headphones although you can get that sound if youre using these wires I think the best way to explain these is you have basically two completely different pair of headphones into one because if youre using them Bluetooth youre going to get a certain type of sound but if youre gonna run these wired and youre gonna run these into an amp you can get a completely different type of sound and I felt like using these wired open these up a lot more it brought out a little more detail and it added a little more thump in the base where I felt like using these with Bluetooth the bass couldnt reach its full potential you know it didnt have that impact like a lot of other headphones and a lot of people are gonna prefer this sound and overall again I think this adds to these sounding is natural as they do because the mid sound fantastic the mids never got lost in the bass it never got lost in the other instruments that were going on I think these did an excellent job of separating the instruments I think these did a great job with the detail and the sound the treble sounded nice and clean but it didnt sound anywhere near harsh so it didnt sound like they were trying to boost these too much and I personally think that what they were going for is a very nice natural warm tone as far as the soundstage and the sound imaging like I said it does an excellent job with detail of instruments I dont feel like these sound as open as I thought they would and maybe thats because having these type of drivers Im used to kind of hearing and openback headphones so Im used to a more open feel now this does feel like youre in a larger room but I guess I was kind of expecting that concert hall sound and it didnt fit that so although I think these are an excellent pair of headphones I do have a few cons this might be nitpicking but I really wish that these folded down just to have you know a smaller footprint if you want to throw them into a bag I think with the amplification it would have been nice to have had some app support so that you can EQ these a little bit now I know that you can have your own app within your phone but if there was an app that was geared more specifically towards the headphones himself it would just feel like maybe you can tune them a little more because everybody is taste and listening to music or movies or whatever its different so to be able to have that control is just nice but outside of that I think this looks like a very clean polished product that youre getting like superior audio compared to a lot of other Bluetooth headphones in a price range thats competing directly with some of the more consumerfriendly type Bluetooth headphones this right here in my opinion destroys the bows and the Sonys but it is a completely different listening experience and this isnt a pair that I would if its something youre trying to block out like your surroundings or airplane noise or stuff like that it just simply doesnt do that so overall my experience with these has been just nothing but Pleasant I have loved picking these up and Ive reached for these more than Ive reached for any other pair of headphones in the time that Ive had them in fact I have to send these back and Im pretty sad that I have to do that but I am gonna be one of those that backs these because I really want to just listen to these more but guys thats my video on

headphones these are a goodlooking set of over ear headphones that come in a variety of different colors on our attractively priced at 35 Pines down the side we can see that theyve got an ergonomic fit vibrant sind 40 millimeter drivers all near controls up to 40 hours of battery life and era foam ear cushions so its a rather attractive package of anything and it might be quite cool for the kids you know you can see the rather striking design its all one color obviously and that reiterates all those features on the back here pointing out where exactly to find them okay so the ergonomic bluetooth headphones with own ear controls yeah alright theres not too much more on the box other than all those features again so lets get it out and have a look at the quality of them at 35 Pines Im not expecting too much because obviously theyve theyve got an awful lot in design and things like that but right from the word go outside of the box we get we get a 35 millimeter headphone cable to pull on one side 3 pull on the other looks fairly standard probably as a part of a couple of feet long then we have a USB charging cable which is micro USB to regular USB very short here we have a quick start guide as to how to use the buttons there we go so volume up volume down track forward and backward button play pause in the middle taking calls pressed play music power to power up power impaired quite difficult to see through the viewfinder here sorry to turn your roars higher headphones on press and hold the large button yeah well come to that alright so their headphones themselves well here they are theyre really light exceptionally light in fact plastic the whole way around faux leather for the ear pieces and on here we have the side which is quite shiny and goodlooking to be honest volume up down left and right and then a clicky power button then we have the USB or micro USB connector here that looks to be an LED there and a microfilm there another than that its fairly simple around here theres not much in the way of adjustment but I suppose whenever youve got two of them acting together that gives you a good couple of inches to encompass the larger heads but I cant imagine too many large headed people using these or older people using these for that matter and here we have right its all plastic construction in here a couple of metal screws and then a foam bumper to make it comfortable on the head left on this side theres no wiggle um so you this is what youre gonna have to stick on your head no matter what theres no adjustment laughter right then here there is actually a bit of a pattern here its not for gripper and things just basic design that doesnt do anything this doesnt do anything and we have a 35 millimeter headphone jack there so if your batteries died and youve remembered to bring a 35 millimeter headphone connector then you can have a go so Im gonna slip them on and see how they go so right to that side so over this way around and they are exceptionally light they really are on that on the ear they dont press in too much around here that I can imagine these being very comfortable on a long road trip if you have if youre having to deal with one so well turn them on and pair them up I heard a little voice theyre saying something our phone has detected them already connected it said and well have a we listen to some tracks okay so listening through a couple of tracks there theyre a wee bit tinny theres not much in the way of BS they feel very very light I would actually recommend using them maybe more so for podcasts than for heavy tunes I listen to quite a bit of rock and punk music and they just didnt quite cut it however theyre 35 pint headphones so I wasnt expecting that much for to get a better sound quality at thats price youre probably better off going with some form of inear headphones because these lose quite a bit what Ill do is Im gonna bring up one of the podcasts so I can play that music and Ill hold this up to our microphone here so you can get an idea of the tennis its the fourth of October and this is tech Alex this week were talking about Google pixels pixel to pixel to excel the whole mini the whole max the pixel book and the big daydream okay so hopefully that gives you a bit of an idea of what to expect from these to be honest I think theyre all about design and for that they look pretty damn good there they are a gorgeous looking pair of headphones and you could do far worse for your money but at the same time you could do a lot better theres theres plenty of other thirty to forty pint headphones out there of a different nature these are over the head headphones so they might work rather well with the microphone and I suppose I could maybe try a call or two but Ill have to report back to let you know how well the microphone operates in calls and that sort of thing where maybe wearing them around the house to take phone calls but thats doesnt really look like what they were planned for so doing a little bit of research to see if I can find out exactly how long the battery would might last or what size the battery is which doesnt seem to be mentioned anywhere in the website or in the documentation I have noticed that it says here that it has a 13 millimeter driver inside on the website as opposed to 40 millimeters than it brags on the box hopefully its just a typo on the website were going to throw these at depaul for him to review and let us know what he thinks of it in all honesty alright cool thanks for watching let me know if you

are the Sam Heiser momentum free in ear wireless headphones Music Applause Music so these are the San Heiser momentum free linear wireless headphones the breacher signed they are a pretty decent looking pair of hundred and seventy pound headphones that obviously have inline controls noise cancelling Im guessing that might be in there Im a pretty novel little twist at the back so that you can use them on the go so here we have we we manage the calls and music through the inline controller it has bluetooth version 42 AAC Qualcomm apdex Qualcomm act X low latency and a magnetic clasp weve seen out on a few very cheap headphones so its nice to see it included in some of the more expensive brands as well cause its a novel way to store your headphones superior wireless listening experience provided by bluetooth technology elegant around the neck designed for allday listening experience real leather carry case for your convenience and then theres caption on the app store and some of the smaller specifications laid out there for you in multiple languages alright so lets dig in and see what they look like alright so theyre quite neatly presented to be honest it all seems to be quite nice the the manual things are stuck to the back here on top of this foam box and then on the top here we have a micro USB cable I believe this is yeah about a half a meter long maybe its not anymore my smokes micro USB cable with the Sun hows your branding I have a couple of these knockin around and they are pretty good quality ok so we also have a nice little hockey puck style kiyose thats quite lovely actually that screams quality actually catch you with the red stitching the rather nice intricately designed zipper bit which is a kind of crew me its a crummy texture to it whilst being a dark kind of silver or grey if you like Im guessing the headphones are probably inside this which they are laughingly presented much like a set of diamond earrings without lovely Sam Heiser glittery and to them so this bit is so if so just like that and it becomes a pillbox we have silica and the some Heiser headphones themselves which come Id us such they appear to be earbuds that are very similar to the other momentum ones that weve looked at in the past so I imagine theyre gonna sign just as good without three there I dont want to wreck the box cause quite a nice presentation okay so here we have them right so this is the move out of this so we can get our focus to one so were here we have the main bud we have a little n ear connector uhhuh yes I figured Im mrs missing something there yeah we have other ones here there are dinky ones medium and large and then probably the recommended size to be the ones that are on it so we have these on the end pull this away there we have the drivers looking very nice small its it is plastic here yeah theres all plastic but thats making it light and quite durable not as durable as if it was metal but then it would be happy wouldnt it Im pull itself out of your ear we have a little silver than black then back to that crew Myshkin dove dark gray color and around here we have this neat little piece that here that keeps your ear wire from moving too much so itll prevent fraying and it is its very tough well I have the same design on the the Momentums with the can hair bound neck piece which Ill link to at the end of the show and then theres a small maybe inch and a half of wire and then this piece which is obviously going to weigh a dime but it could actually act as a counterbalance to the one on the other side its not particularly heavy as a matter of fact its its lighter than the ear piece itself so shouldnt really have too much of an effect on it there are no controls on this at all it is just a an in wire piece so not must be the battery then or something or an extended battery then we have a wire all the way down to here Im an adjustable piece that allows you to I know my wife likes likes to tie this around her hair bound or her her ponytail sorry as like a hair bombed when shes running and it helps keep them in place some people like to do that or they just leave it dangling and flapping but it its a little bit of cable management that runners tend to like quite a bit then we follow on down to the inline controls and we have an up   and the main button and then theres a microUSB cable connector there with a cover to allow the person to keep it somewhat sweatresistant or a little extra bit of water if it were to hit you because there is no IP rating on these I dont believe no there is no way I mention all waterproof or water resistance at all anywhere in and the microphone I am wondering if though you know thats supposed to be up like that so your nail can catch it quite easily okay simple simple and then some hyzer on the bottom and then up to the other earbud which is exactly the same as the one the other side I guess you can only put these into your ear one way so this would be the right yes thats the right because putting it into the left means that this comes out and goes backward on itself which is quite uncomfortable so youre not gonna get them the wrong way wrong then it feels natural to push that in like that yeah so thats your right and oddly enough this is your left okay Im gonna have a go at testing these to see how well they work and I have an idea Im not sure how well its gonna work but oh Ill give it a go okay so a sec effectively my idea is to take this time microphone which Im talking into now and hold it up to the headphone as there is a podcast playing that podcast from the tech addicts crew has some pretty swell music which is similar to the music at the opening of this video and a little bit of spoken word so will give you a better idea of how well this sign so obviously these are not burned in or anything theyre straight out of the box but can get a bisque idea of how well the signed signs so well do that now its the 8th of November and this is tech addicts this week Rickys got a new iPhone he also has a new Xbox one axe razor phones be launched I got a Ritter from teammate only identify for phones you could buy for the price one thing that we havent done yet is to test the magnetic bottoms okay so it does it clicks together much like this isnt that fantastic all right so if you have any questions let me know in the

"collection_date": "20201007 102247365784", "video_id": "pgWWoc_w5EI", "Closed Captions": " Music everybody loves apples new beats solo three wireless headphones the only thing that makes them better is the special edition Mickeys 90th anniversary version that comes with a bunch of accessories to go along with it and a really unique design these have been out for a little while now but we finally just got our hands on some and were really excited to show them off so if you havent seen them this is your chance you see what you get inside compared to going for just the stock beats solo three Wireless out of the gate the attention to detail is insane there are so many little touches that really make these headphones above really most of the other ones youre ever gonna find on the market even inside the back of the top of the box theres little imprints of Disney going around the edges it is very very cool youre greeted at first by that Disney pin which were gonna come back to which below youll find the canvas bag that is actually going to hold your headphones its not canvas more like a wool type bag to hold the headphones and then underneath all of that a few getting started guides and paperwork carabiner clip and audio cord for taking phone calls and controlling music and the power cord itself so back to that pain that you saw right when you open it up the special 90s 90th anniversary Disney pin even the back of this has the little Mickey ears on it it is metal and then you got the beats logo and the Disney Mickey logo there on the bottom right if anyone who collects pins this is just a cool thing a cool little thing to be included in the box attach it to the side headphones or wherever you want to save it now we dont need to go through all these getting started guides its a lot of what you would come to expect from the beats solo degree because basically how to get these things up and going but what is really cool is you also get a beats sticker the same thing as the pin button sticker form so apples always done this beats has done this you get beats het stickers in the box apple sticker in the box same thing here but now were getting that ninetieth Mickey anniversary sticker so another cool little touch that gets included with these headphones so the two cables that you got with this thing the first cable that is included is the power cable so you use these things to charge everything up unfortunately compared to some of Apples other more recent headphones these things still charge via microUSB so you still got to keep this around if youre an Apple user youre not necessarily going to have one of these cables in your rotation you often have lightning cables maybe some USB see looking towards the future but if you pick these up you still need to have a microUSB cable as far as powering these up they charge super quick you can actually get three hours of use out of them after only a five minute charge and then of course we have an audio cable that you can plug into there plug into the bottom of your phone assuming you have an adapter on one of the newer ones or playing to your computer and you can use it to take calls and theres an inline controller set as well you can use to control the music though there are controls on the headphones themselves but you can use this wired if youd prefer rather than wirelessly so back to the headphones beats headphones often contain these little carrying pouch is we have another one here thats very unique to these with that Disney and beats logo right there on the front its kind of like a marina wool very soft feeling to it and its going to protect those headphones whenever theyre thrown into your bag carabiner clip can also be attached to the end of it to clip on to the side of a bag and Apple did include that in the box so these are the headphones themselves they look pretty awesome a bunch of Disney Mickey Mouse caricatures going around the edges they kind of move on to the cups just a little bit a lot of really premium materials that weve seen though they are still plastic which I note some people had problems with plastic level on the beats headphones but these are pretty awesome headphones and they have the same specs as a standard beats solo three Wireless on this left hand cup here you can see we can play pause in the center as well as change the volume up and down by pressing on the actual cup itself and on the right hand side is where youll find the actual power button to turn it on and on either cup there is either the headphone jack on this left hand side and on the right hand side youll find the micro USB port to actually charge them what makes these headphones pretty amazing compared to most headphones on the market and not just their Disney and aspect theyre mickey aspect is east ed apples w1 chip inside which makes for an unbelievable experience they pair effortlessly to your iPhone your iPad your Mac your Apple watch it actually goes to one device and then theyre available on all of your devices so as you switch between them its really really easy to make sure your headphones are kind of following you depending on which device that youre using you can use standard Bluetooth but using the W one you get like a hundred foot range and a bunch of other benefits sound quality still its beats so its going to be on the high end but its not going to be comparable as some of the really upper echelon youre still paying for more of the brand it so has a little bit of extra base but audio quality has come a long way from where the beats brand used to be if you want to pick these up theyre really amazing youll find the link below in the description and I want to hear your thoughts down below in the comments Music

Captions": " If you try to wear your headphones like this you wont become Cyclops So a friend of mine let me borrow his Skullcandy uproar wireless headphones So when I first listened to these headphones and I saw the MRP which clearly says rupees 5499 that is about almost 80 US dollars I felt that these are very very overpriced for the kind of quality of the sound they produce for the quality of the materials used in the headphones and for the comfort So theres a volume up volume down key the same buttons also skip tracks The middle button is the power button and you also need to hold this while you are pairing it with your device for the very first time So definitely these cushions could have used some work they could have been more Comfortable These are clearly and very easily onear headphones not overear Headphones I have no idea why they tried to put these cushions on top of the Headphone its quite small and quite thin to give any sort of comfort to any head whatsoever I could be wrong you could have a soft head and it serves the purpose to you Of course I have a hard head One thing I noticed is that as you can see the wire is clearly visible right on the plastic part so I would say for the wire its not quite a safe proposition and you need to be very careful when you pack these headphones in your bag or just throw them around because these wires can easily cut off These are not heavy headphones at all The build quality does feel cheap but I think if the materials of the plastic used on these headphones are good then they can really last you long What Ive read on some reviews online that people do say that they are very reliable and they have lasted a very long time for them so if I believe in those customer reviews I would start to feel that yes this light plastic is really of good quality but only time can tell that So out of the box you get a micro USB charging cable and a headphones thats it A user manual and stuff like that So I mostly listen to trance on these which is the primary genre of music which I listen to I felt the sound is quite balanced the bass is decent if I push myself into believing that these headphones should really cost around 25 to 30 USD dollars then I would truly enjoy the sound but if Skullcandy tries to sell these to me for 80 US dollars which is almost rupees 5500 in Indian currency then I would truly hate these headphones The primary reason for hating these headphones wont be the sound but the comfort they provide The plastic if it is of really good quality or not only time can tell that but apart from these things what I can immediately check is the quality of the sound and the comfort The quality of sound is just just above average for 25 to 30 US dollars headphones bluetooth headphones but the comfort on my head they were not comfortable at all So as some of you may know that I have a big heada big head These were truly uncomfortable for me I couldnt wear them more than lets say 30 minutes or so without taking them off taking a little break and then again putting them back on One more thing I noticed that these headphones do not have a very high volume when I reached the maximum volume level both on my phone and on the headphones Its not bad its not very low but but it is a thing which is good to know These headphones claim they have 40mm drivers and I believe so and I think apart from the 40mm driver inside of it there is nothing else About the battery life the battery can easily last you for a day and even more than that if you are not a crazy maniac and you use your headphones for 15 hours straight The charging time is around 3 to 4 hours which is quite fine for the backup its providing If you want to see more reviews on Bluetooth headphones let me know in the comment section and do subscribe to my channel because it motivates me a lot for making videos past midnight So if you are getting these headphones under some deals some amazing deals like how I saw an Amazon US for 25 to 30 US dollar so you can definitely purchase these headphones but do not purchase them at their maximum retail price that is for sure these are these are not worth that price at all and if you notice these headphones were made in China So is everything else Except for Apple flagship phones now they are being made in India So I would say these headphones have a balanced sound the bass is decent the clarity is fine but do not expect anything exceptional from these headphones They are just another average headphones which are there out in the market to please you if you just wanted a branded bluetooth headphone So I think skullcandy here did try to charge you a lot for a headphones which could have easily costed half of its MRP which is Indian rupees 5500 and round about 80 US dollars But when I looked at some deals on the same headphones on Amazon US I noticed that these went as low as 25 US dollars and believe me for that much amount of money even for 30 US dollars these are really good headphones provided that you dont have a huge head So you are going to be fairly pleased with these headphones if you bought them at a good price If you paid anything around 60 or 70 USD or above you will feel you have been cheated So I think this video is supposed to be a responsible video and make you a smart consumer Well hit that subscribe button then I did not mean to roast these headphones in this video but I thought to add some humor and I hope you like it Thats all for today MuBot out The skull here on the headphones signify that they belong to

talking about my favorite headphones now quick back story just about five years ago I made a really cringey video about my favorite headphones at the time which were the audio technica ath em 50s like the original ones the ones with the cable so long that I had to tie an elastic band around them to keep them from falling everywhere now I love those headphones I tried so many other ones in the past and couldnt find anything that sounded really really good for the price and then I ended up finding mkbhd video at the time and then I saw his video bought a used pair and never went back to any other headphones they just sounded so good and I ended up keeping that exact pair until late last year and I beat the crap out of those things using them every single day throwing them in and out of my bag but ever since switching to my essential phone I noticed that I put away my corded headphones in favor of my Jaybirds X twos but something never felt quite right I always missed having that crispy audio quality and the tight punchy bass so I began my hunt and that brings us to today since I liked Audio Technica I ended up looking up to see what models they made and found that their Bluetooth line was expanding quite decently I ended up trying the ath sr6 bt b ches oh my god thats mouthful which were audio Technicas new highresolution bluetooth headphones first of all I did like these headphones but I couldnt figure out what was missing from the sound they were very clear in the highs and the mids which I do love but they lacked so much in the bass it just made music so boring it sounded as if there was a lowpass filter that just removed the bass from all the songs yes it made all the lyrics and the music much clearer but I hated how it sounded they were light and comfortable and I appreciated that they paired with NFC but that just sounded too tinny to keep as my daily drivers pun totally intended by the way and that brought me to the other end of the spectrum with get ready the a th WS six60 btg BLS audio Technicas answered to all the people who wanted bass in their headphones but it turns out that those people also hate hearing vocals and midrange music fun fact these headphones although they are great for bass heavy music with no vocals I just couldnt deal with them sounding muddy half the time I really tried to give these a go but they were just so light and they would fall off constantly I hated how they felt on my head I just couldnt trust them not to break after everyday use so I finally gave in and bit the bullet and decided to spend the money and try out the m50x bTW much more reasonable name by the way and holy crap I am home Audio Technica it just just hold me I was a lost child out in the rain and I finally saw the light no seriously all jokes aside the moment I put these headphones on my head I felt like an old friend came back into my life and everything was just right in the world I kid you not these are literally the perfect headphones and Im hardpressed to believe that you could find something to impress me more at the same value as these guys same as my review from five years ago they sound absolutely phenomenal with striking highs full meds and the tight punchy bass that I love although they are a little bit bigger than your average headphones the benefit of them being on the bulkier side allows them to fit in those 45 millimeter drivers which make them so special and the fact that they use the Qualcomm aptX standard for Bluetooth which gives them a decent bandwidth advantage over other regular headphones also that giant battery Ive said it so many times in the past and Ill say it again I cannot believe that there is a better pair of headphones that exist out there at a better value than these honestly if youre worried about spending the money trust me they will last you a lifetime since these are bluetooth I cant speak about how the battery will last over time but as of right now its ridiculous how long of battery I got on these I was actually waiting for them to die to test them and see if it worked without a battery and just a cable and it took me almost two weeks to kill them when I first got them I was using them every single day and for the first week they still said they were at 80 I just couldnt get it below that your mileage may vary based on how much you use them in terms of battery life but for me two weeks is basically guaranteed because I plugged them in and use them wired when Im at my desk at work and yes they do work that way which is awesome along with when the Bluetooth is off you can use them without a battery by just plugging in the cable and thats such a godsend I dont know why more headphones dont do this so all in all this isnt as much a review as much as a confession of my love for the m50x BTS and honestly I think you owe it to yourself to give them a shot or dont because everything else was Im terrible after thanks so much for watching guys this was a bit of a different style of video I know but as a five year user of these headphones I had a bit more to save and just how comfortable they are it feels good to be making videos again apologies theres a few months of nothing its been the most hectic time of my life now to kick off 2019 and I promise Im not gone and I will be making more videos this year Ive got a couple exciting videos lined up and I hope that you guys are excited to see them subscribe so you dont miss them and thanks everyone for 4000 subscribers it truly means a lot to see people interested in what I have to say anyway so Ill see you guys on the next one take care", "video_title": "The ATHM50xBT are the Best Wireless Headphones  5 Year Later Review 2019", "video_comment_count": "700", "video_dislike_count": "100",

wireless headphones in the past but i think i finally found a set that suits this irregular sized cranium so why do i think the steel series arctis 9 are finally the wireless headphones for me i mean firstly they look great theyre clean simple theyve got this nice matte finish to them the steel frames sturdy while being lights but because theyre not overly gamery i feel like i can actually wear these away from my desk if i want to go for a walk or other shops and not have little timmy point and look and be like oh look theres a nerd lets get him and if i want to get away from my desk i can even hide the microphone inside the ear cup so this point theyre just a nice set of earphones like i said the steel frame makes them extremely durable lightweight flexible to the point that paired with the ski goggle headband that steel series use even on my giant head theyre perfectly comfortable so if you have a human sized head and youre not some kind of missing evolution link like i am chances are theyre gonna be a great fit for you as well im also a huge fan of the breathable ear cups that steel series use none of that fake plastic leather sort of thing that gets real sweaty when your room is anything above like 20 degrees celsius and if you have headphones for too long they start flaking off and falling apart no no no no no nice and breathable nice and comfortable feels great against my skin ive been wearing these for six to ten hours a day for the past 5 days and i have not had a single complaint or felt discomfort even once but headphones aside for a second the other feature that comes in the box is the steelseries wireless hub this is probably it probably makes one of my favorite features of the whole kit that you get now steelseries claims that this thing has a range of 40 feet using its 24 gigahertz wireless connection i havent been walking around with a tape measure i must admit but i have been able to go to every room in my house and venture forth with into the garden without any quality drop or any signals cutting out whatsoever so for normal everyday use this thing is probably going to go above and beyond what you want it to do but you also have the option of using the 24 gigahertz wireless connection in tandem with the bluetooth capability of the headphones that means for if if for some bizarre reason you want to wear these listen to your game audio and your discord audio but also play music through your phone to the headphones you can do that i dont know really why youd want to do that that sounds like a bit of a cacophony to me but hey its nice to have options but for me the best quality of life that dongle gives you as opposed to standard wireless headphones that just come on a usb is that the hub features audio in and out now that means you can use your computer speakers in tandem with the wireless headphones and what i mean by that is that as soon as you turn the headphones on your computer audio will switch from speaker to headphones and vice versa as soon as you turn them off back to speakers and its doing all that without you having to suffer and like oh go down i need to go to my my device menu speakers virtual headphones select playback device none of that its a faff its not going to mess up your discord input outputs its not going to make you suffer through scrolling down its a minor issue i know but its a its so frustrating when you just want to listen to your speakers it only takes a few seconds and it means that i dont have to fiddle with windows select playback device nonsense its not going to mess up my discord audio inputs or outputs just turn the thing off listen to my computer its a small feature but i love it it fixes that pet peeve for me bless speaking of discord the microphone thats included is discord certified now its not going to blow your socks off when it comes to audio quality but its got enough gain its got enough noise cancellation that doesnt pick up my clicky clacky keyboard and most importantly its clear enough that i can make effective enemy call outs when playing escape from tarkov or deliver my wellrehearsed speech as to why im in fact not the imposter while playing among us with friends the overall sound quality of these has been pretty great they do come out of the box pretty level across the board maybe if not a touch heavy on the bass but if youre like me you like a bassier experience when it comes to your games and music then theyre likely going to be ideal if you do want to tailor your audio experience a bit more steel series has its own software with an equalizer so you can really tailor the audio experience to suit your tastes the axis nines also come with dts headphones 20 which is meant to simulate that kind of surround sound vibe inside your headphones now for me and the games i play its completely fine ive not noticed a huge uptick in me being able to pinpoint enemy locations or really know which angle gunfire is coming from but from what im aware in the sevens it was an optionable toggleable thing in the software now it seems like a small step back keeping it enabled all the time ive looked in the software and i cant find the option to turn it off so its its not a hugely intrusive feature but its a shame that you dont have the option to play around with it and flick it on and off you also have the onthefly game to avoid mix controls so with a little turn of this wheel you can turn your discord up or your game up in relation to each other makes it world easy and you dont have to tab out and fiddle with your levels you just turn the wheel find something that suits you and youre comfortable with my only gripe with these controls however is they are exactly where your thumbs sit where you put the headphone on or you take off so pretty much every time i take the headset off or put it on im messing with the levels that i might have been happy with before or ill rejoin a discord call after go and get a parcel or go to the bathroom or whatever and all of a sudden i cant hear anything and i have to spend like 20 seconds just oh well i can hear you again yep oh no hang on oh they left the call with these minor gripes aside though this thing does everything i want it to music movies games let me sit on the toilet without audio interruptions dude what the hell all that coupled with a 20 hour battery life as well as being able to use these on my ps4 and steelseries have said that they will work on the upcoming ps5 that is the whole feature set except for the chat to game volume mixer ive got to say me and my large head we couldnt be that much happier oh but before i go this one thing on the box really made me laugh the box says pros have won more prize money with steel series than any other brand i good for them i mean im not gonna win no money im a bit of a scrub but hey steel series i respect the weird flex but for nearly a week of me using these things those are my thoughts let

This is the Avant rewire less headphone transmitter set so this is the Avant rewire less headphone transmitter set product code HT four one eight nine if youre here to see what this does you probably know what type of product this already is if you just happen to walk upon this it is essentially a wireless headphone and transmitter set that you plug this into the TV sit back and listen to it on this so you dont disturb the other folks in the hice ors flat or apartment or a vote that you happen to be dwelling or dwelling that you happen to be a boding if you need help you can contact the people there and here we have some of the facts and features no pairing is required no lip sync delay thats a bold statement optical support and up to 40 hours playtime haha there are some more specifications down there for you to run down and have a readout and guess theres something that you want to know like the frequency response on the impedance the driver size is 40 millimeters hmm okay so it runs off bluetooth 42 no bluetooth 41 the headphones are for use with 41 but the transmitter is 42 uses a dude a 2d p and supports various codecs and operates up to either 100 feet or 30 meters alright so lets get it right hook it up and see how it works already we have support information right on the front of the box with phone numbers that you can call if youre in trouble with it how wonderful is that how often you see that that well done Avon tree you deserve a round of applause one hold all in a box so am I let you upload quietly Adam okay inside we get a user guide on the top get a care product or sorry get a free product buy four or more Avanti products and get a fifth one for free of equal or lesser value than the cheapest item purchased yes still on five point points off when you spend no five dollars off when you spend 25 or more that worksite does have the UK numbers on the back there so there there there Boston for you to get in touch with them decent amount of instructions therefore if and when things may go wrong here is the transmitter okay so we have a Vaughn tree written there Im guessing these little buttons light up whenever we start to use them and weve got a and B USB auxiliary optical Bluetooth SBC FS apdex and ll so Im guessing that SBCs one of the codecs a fascist fast stream isnt it and then aptX is apt X and I thought apt accent dear or ll or the sea and or well maybe there are maybe theres no a slightly different version okay run the back we have the model number input us 500 milliamps optical and FCC information little rubber feet and yeah we have stuff around the back we have ports on the back so we have the DC in which is a micro USB we have an optical kick cable we have an optical port and auxiliary and an onoff switch very simple and Im guessing these are just channels that you can switch between in case youre getting interference or something like that bomb I could be wrong and then we have the headphones which are actually really nice yes they are theyre theyre kind of the old school style headphones and theyre very light so well start at the top we have like a faux leather on the top with some brine stitching and theyre adjustable with the cool old fashioned bits of metal sticking out for you to adjust and theres a braided cable that connects well obviously one to the other that goes up and in here and theres a little bit of rubber here with a bit of a texture on it which is kind of nice theres a little instruction guide there of how to turn it on so yeah well come back and then there might be maybe a microphone with some description there theres a something you can pull out okay so thats the microUSB for charging and now 35 millimeter headphone jack for the possible time that you actually run out of charge theres another hole there that could be an LED light you know the dishonor off then that could be Id love to think that that was a microphone so its possible it could be well check that out in the review and we have some nice ear cups theyre very soft leather with a bit of foam in here as well its not just a piece of material covering the driver that was actual fool in there thats thats nice it looks like its gonna be quite comfortable then on the side we have which is the right headphone so we have the indicators here we have avantis Nouveau there have on trees Louisville there and thats that so press and hold mfb for three seconds until blue LED is on for one second okay so we got a blue LED and it said welcome to of on treesweet okay and click volume up and down to change the volume right so what we need to do is set something up to be able to test this with using this one thing springs to mind now that Ive just run around and find a 35 millimeter headphone jack Ill have a look at Messiah see what else there is Wow we get on an optical cable as well and then we get a bunch of cables brilliant Ive on tree thinking thats wonderful okay so we get a micro USB cable for charging Martenot charging powering which we will plug in okay so were still in the off position I suppose Im looking for lights and were not the enemy we have another microUSB cable Im guessing for charging these we have a 35 millimeter headphone jack the 35 millimeter headphone jack cable and we have followed a phono which this isnt entirely compatible with okay so I run a run find these so Im going to use these Ive plugged it in to my phone to stream some music Im gonna go for a little bit of Led Zeppelin I believe and if I turn this on actually Im going to place these on my head so that I can tell you what audio cues there are lets treat it its telling me that its connected straightaway its scanning and its find that theres an axillary plugged in and that Bluetooth is there if we hit over to be its not let me do anything there but Im gonna go straight away Im try this and just see how the music signs coming through on the on the headphones alright so having listened through to two songs on Led Zeppelin there they are pretty good headphones they they do give off a good sign theyre theyre very well tuned for music and the volume works very well too I took it down to dying stairs with them I dont that the building Im in isnt particularly large its a double garage with a roof space so I took it down to Ron both rooms downstairs it didnt cut out or anything that was that there was no particular disturbance whatsoever it was a very very strong signal the whole time so Im gonna have a quick blast at some some Netflix just to see how how well it copes with me skipping around and things like that to see if it keeps up with the lipsync as it brags alright so Netflix and YouTube do sound very good on these as well theyre theyre good allround headphones I have to say and the fact that theyre streaming live from this makes them a pretty good option no I have had a look at some of these in the past from one end of the spectrum to the other Ive seen the the San Heiser flex 5000 that I own myself and I love I use those quite frequently no as frequently as I thought I would I also had a look at jelly combs offering which was a lot cheaper than these I believe there were 30 pounds in total and they did very well as well however the headphones were nowhere near as comfortable as these these things are fantastically comfortable initially having only used them for a few minutes to skip through some some good signing stuff and good music and Im quite impressed with these and I think I would sit down for an evening but Im not going to have that option I got to fire these out to Peter for him to do a full review on so let me know if you have any questions or anything you want them to test in particular in the show notes down below

" hey everyone Jordan here with ninetofive toys and today we have something really exciting we have the brand new wireless headphones from drop these are the panda and so a drop is trying to do is create a audio file level pair of wireless headphones and these are a preproduction model these are I think one of the first samples that theyve really sent out for review so were getting to take a look at it and Im excited to share it with you so lets check it out thanks for watching nine to five toys be sure to LIKE subscribe and enable notifications so you dont miss any upcoming videos so if youre not familiar with drop or mass drop as it used to be called they were originally a kind of a group of buying website so communities would come together and you know agree to purchase you know one or more of a certain product and then they would go to the company and say hey we have you know three hundred orders for this thing can we get a special deal on it and so bring the price a little bit down and then they would you know pick something else and all the community would get together and once they had enough votes they would all vote for it so its kind of how mass drop started but then as I continued they took that community mindset and started using it to develop and design different pieces of equipment and clothing and the latest one they came out with is this and its called the Panda a wireless pair of headphones that should give audiophile quality sound and you are gonna be paying a little bit more for that audiophile quality sound right now the MSRP is 399 so obviously not the cheapest pair of headphones but if youre looking for the highest quality wireless headphones you can find and youre probably spending something in that price point anyways so right off the bat one of the things that I really like about the Panda is its a very simple functional elegant design and actually you dont Ive only found the drop name in two different places once its you know very small here on the inside of the headband right here youll get a closeup of that and then the other one is on the strap of the carrying case you know other than that there arent really any markings all over it its a very simple elegant functional design which I really enjoy so on the right ear cup well find the USB port for charging the control stick a super small discreet status LED and if you look close there are two microphones and on the left hand we have only the 35 milimeter port for passive inputs the control stick which is located here on the right ear cup can be moved up down left right four different controls I can evolve all Youm down skipping the next tracks and then also for controlling calls and then it can also be pushed in for pausing and playing and accepting and rejecting calls as well I really like this method of controlling wireless headphones thats something we saw on the Marshall headphones we checked out a little while ago the little four directional control they can also be pushed in and thats just a really really nice tactile way of controlling all the functions on your headphone without putting in a bunch of different buttons on here and well show you the design of the case really quick so you open it up and theres a little other little pocket in here where you can put your cables so you have it comes with release this one did Im not sure what the actual production unit will but this one came with a USB typec cable and also a 35 millimeter to 35 millimeter cable those just easily stick down and there theres a little magnet that closes that so it was really nice and secure and with the headphones obviously they are adjustable you can pull them out and push them back in to fit your head but the nice thing about this case is that even fully extended you can just lay them down in here and itll still fit fine you dont have to push them in and you know totally mess up your adjustment setting which is a really nice feature on the inside of the ear cups Ive actually been noticing a few companies doing this lately which Im a huge fan of you just put a big L and a big R right inside the ear cups to let you know which is left and which is right I think thats a very classy way of doing it you know it doesnt put it anywhere else but its also very visible there but not visible when you are wearing the headphones so in the announcement post that drop posted they said that the weight was going to be at or under 350 grams and so I put this on steel and tested it out and it was coming in at a little bit over that at 380 so obviously 30 grams isnt a whole lot but I was kind of curious what was causing that difference and if they actually intended on hitting that 350 mark for production line so I sent a message to their head of product marketing and asked them you know what is causing that difference and if they plan on actually hitting that mark for production and he said that the engineers said that on this limited sample run they actually had to change the damping solution a little bit so they think thats whats causing the difference in weight but they still plan on hitting the 350 mark and if they dont that theyll just update the specs to you know reflect what actually is and despite that extra weight I didnt find the pan that cumbersome at all I mean dont get me wrong they are a substantial pair of headphones they have a little bit of weight to them but I dont really take that as a bad thing it kind of feels like theyre a little bit higher quality because of that you know what also helps with that is you know in combination with the headband which has a little rubberized grip on here so it doesnt move much and the grip from the ear cups on your head it feels really comfortable with the cushions as well drop actually designed to the Panda so that the weight is held by the grip from the ear cups not so much the headband and these protein leather wrapped plush foam ear cups pack plenty of padding they feel plenty comfortable I didnt have any issues wearing them so obviously these are meant to be used on the go in a mobile setting and at their core they are a closed back design which also aids in acoustic isolation you wont find any active noisecancelling on these but because of the grip from the ear cups and the closed back design they actually do a pretty decent job of blocking out a lot of noise itll be something similar to like a in ear monitor so design wise the only flaw that Ive really seen with the Panda so far is and Im gonna attribute it to this being a preproduction sample but on the headband theres one little corner that the little rubber grip keeps kind of sticking out and coming loose a little bit and so like I said Im just gonna trigger that to being a flaw of you know these sample units and I highly doubt thatll be a issue in in the actual production run and the rest of this feels extremely well built extremely solid and Ive been very pleased with the fit and finish of the drop so one really nice thing was that I attended CES 2020 recently and will bright who is a cofounder of drop and also heads up most of the product development was there with thx showing off these headphones and talking about how theyre using the thx technology within the headphones and so hes obviously really excited about these headphones because drop finally feels like the technology exists for you know audiophile quality sound in a wireless pair of headphones the combination of driver technology from the Oppo PM 3 thx triplea amplification in Sonys L DAC make it truly one of the best sounding pairs of wireless headphones noticing the popularity of the PM 3 with audio files drop took that technology and brightened it up just a little bit to kind of offset the common critique that the PM 3 is were just a little bit too dark and to power those drivers drop is using the thx triple a discrete amplifier and it drives listening plenty loud uncomfortably loud for me at max volume that being said I did try it for a albeit short amount of time at max volume and I didnt hear any distortion when listening to him and then the third technology that makes this possible to get a wireless audio file pair of headphones is Sonys L DAC beyond just Bluetooth aptX aptX HD and aptX adaptive this L DAC is the closest wireless headphones can get to true audiophile bit rates unfortunately I was told that this isnt operational in this sample pair yet so I wasnt able to actually try that which is a bummer but even without that these things sound incredible the combination of those three technologies creates an incredible sounding pair of headphones that are easy to use when mobile polarity of bounds to pick out instruments and cluttered tracks and the neutral tone puts it squarely in the reference category also mentioned in drops announcement of the Panda is that theres no DSP found in panda another big thing that they wanted to push with the Panda was battery life obviously this is a wireless pair of headphones that you want to be able to use for a while so they claim that Ill have up to 30 hours of battery life thats really impressive for a pair of headphones that can get this loud when I first opened the box and turned them on there was a voice prompt that told me that the battery was low and then they ended up actually turning off because the battery was so low so I plugged it in and started charging it and within about two hours it was fully charged and the LED light was white letting me that it was ready to go speaking of mobility these also have microphone builtin so that you can take calls while youre listening to music and so here well give a little sample of what that sounds like and I think we mentioned earlier but the microphones are located there to little things down here on the right ear cup so Ill put these on I have them connected to my phone already and were just going to start recording in the voice memos app on my iPhone 8 thanks for watching 900 to 500 toys be sure to LIKE subscribe and enable notifications with the bell icon C dont miss any upcoming videos hi this is Jordan with ninetofive toys so there you can get an idea of what the microphone sounds like obviously its not you know perfect but its not bad either and its really easy to find the controls here to control all of that so allinall Ive been really happy with the drop Panda wireless headphones the battery life is great the sound is incredible theyre comfortable and I think theyre really well designed they are a little bit expensive at 399 but if youre looking for you know highquality wireless headphones this is obviously going to be one of your best choices for that and also unfortunately these arent available yet this is a preproduction sample unit so right now drop is thinking that at the end of January is when the product will launch but will actually start shipping closer to summer so itll be a little bit till we actually see these available on the market but drop is doing different events around the country we can actually go check them out so at CES they had a couple different examples available and I think theyre hosting something at their office as well if you are close to that and want to go check it out I hope you enjoyed this look at the preproduction version of the drop panda and thanks for watching if you

"video_id": "wMeQ3Syvurs", "Closed Captions": " hey everyone digital David here today were going to be unboxing and reviewing the bull tuned bluetooth wireless earbuds they did send me this product review but any opinion expressed this video is strictly my own if you are interested in this product the link to it will be in my video description below please go ahead check it out do your shopping from there so the bull tune wireless earbuds come packaged to you just like this from Amazon in a really nice retail box looks really cool there really impressed that they have 16 hours of battery life bluetooth 50 theyre ipx7 rated which means they can be submerged for 30 minutes in up to 3 feet of water takes roughly 5 minutes to charge these to get 2 hour of playback time other than that you can charge them fully in about an hour in a half so now lets go ahead and open them up here all the package contents we have a nice travel mesh bag right here with drawstrings a really indepth user guide a nice thank you note with their contact information and their website the headphones themselves these are really nice wireless earbuds with a magnetic clasp and a great ergonomic design we have some other tips for your ears depending on your size so were gonna have a small medium and large and then we have a nice USB to micro USB charging cable lets go ahead now look at the headphones in more detail and set them up with our phone got them unraveled right here they look really nice if you can see from the camera this is your last earbud they even identify it for you here is your right ear bud as well love these little hook clips whatever you want to call them these are perfect for exercising running working out at the gym so they will not fall out of your ears again I already showed you but theres the magnetic clasp that looks really nice I think the blacks are really sweet color and then we can see on the right ear bud we have your controls right here so we have your plus your  and your play and on side we have your USB port right there it says close the flap when not charging so you definitely want to keep that closed especially if these are going to get wet if youre out in the rain or youre sweating that sort of thing so now lets go ahead lets power them up and connect them to our phone so I just powered on the earbuds they fit great in my ears really nice really like how they feel love how those hooks just stay and there to keep it from falling out so it said when I turn it on that its pairing now Im in my Bluetooth device and were pairing it right here its searching for available devices and I found it its the ball tune B T dash B H zero zero one maybe you can see that from a camera so were going to select that and its gonna pair to the device now the device is connected I can see we have a hundred percent battery so now we can go ahead we can test out the audio and sound quality so I just listened to some music on Spotify I gotta say I am really impressed with the base in these wireless earbuds Ive reviewed a lot of wireless earbuds and the base is usually alright kind of what you would expect I gotta say this is definitely one of the better base drivers that Ive heard from Wireless here but given their size so it sounds really nice really full and really powerful so Im actually a little shocked that it sounds so good now Im gonna try to hold up some music to the microphone so you can see if you can hear it yourself Music hopefully youre able to hear that sound engage a little bit better for yourself the sound quality from listening to music with these Im sorry you cant be here right next to me to actually listen yourself now were go ahead were gonna test out the microphone quality Im going to play back that raw audio for you so you can see how it sounds hi David its me David just checking out the microphone quality on the Bolton wireless earbuds right here hopefully everything sounds great were going to start making some noise first banging around the see if it picks up any of that were going to touch the earbuds in the microphone and everything else as well now for fun Im gonna go out take out on my ear put it all the way out there bring it around to my mouth and back now well put it back in well take the other well take both out were moving all the way out here see if it still sounds good now well bring it back see if everything is still good so it was such a pleasure talking with you David I enjoy our conversations and I cant wait to talk with you again so I just listen to the microphone quality myself I gotta say it sounds fine given this price point that quality is definitely on par maybe even a little better than you would normally expect so overall I think it sounds great but I want to hear what you think in the comments below let me know your thoughts on that microphone quality now were to go ahead were gonna play some music again and were gonna submerge it in water just so you see that it is ipx7 rated I do not recommend swimming or submerging these in water but it does have that rating so we got to check it out in this video so I got a song playing again and were going to take it for a little dip everything still sounds great you can see that they stuck together underwater we have the charging port covered as well so were gonna go ahead and just stick everything in there for a minute just so you can see that its submerged in the water I can still hear the music it sounds great yep definitely still working I can see the Bluetooth light still flashing theres a little blue LED indicator light on the front so were in good shape right there cool everything still sounds great were gonna dry these off and put them back on so I just dried them off listen to some more music everything sounds great these would be great your butts to have if you like to listen to music in the shower and youre looking for a pair of headphones or like we said you like to run in the rain or

wireless headphones that have active noise cancellation the taotronics sound surge 60 and the cohen SE sevens the taotronics will cost about 70 whereas the Cohens cost about 120 both are available on Amazon and quite often have discounts that can be applied in addition to make them even cheaper the reason I want to look at these two headphones is because they show up in a lot of searches for what the best value headphones are both are very similar in terms of styling with matte black finishes and very sporty looks with very minimal branding something that appealed to me right away so lets take a look first lets talk about battery life both claimed to give about 30 hours of playback the taotronics come in really close to that I would say Im getting about 30 hours on average whereas the Cohens come in closer to about 20 hours when youre using active noise cancellation so given that I would have to give the advantage to the taotronics additionally they do offer fast charging so in five minutes of charging you can get an additional two hours of playback time here whereas with the cohens its about 10 minutes of charging to get an additional out which isnt bad but overall in terms of battery it definitely goes to the Payette rocks next lets talk about the build fit and form both are pretty well built they have that very similar matte black finish with this hard plastic which feels quite nice to the touch I would have to give the advantage here though in terms of build quality to the Coens overall theyre just a little sturdier and this hinge mechanism puts up some resistance which feels quite premium additionally the earcup pads are very very soft theyre protein based as opposed to standard foam which is really nice and very very comfortable if youre going to be wearing them for extended periods of time I regularly wear them for about two to three hours time I would have to say that these are definitely more comfortable than the taotronics having said that the ear cups are smaller on these compared to the taotronics so you will have to take that into consideration if you do have larger ears additionally theyre not quite as stable on your because the TAM trying to provide a little bit more clamping force overall it is nice that both of them do fold up a nice and compact lets say the cones are slightly smaller overall but not enough to make a real difference taking a look at the controls both are very similar they have the same buttons so you get power onoff volume updown and then a toggle in order to enable active noise cancellation on the taotronics that toggle is on the front with a little LED that shows up whereas on the Coens that button is on the back in order to hide the LED its kind of nice that its a little more discreet but overall the buttons are a little closer here which makes it harder to distinguish between them so I have to get the advantage to the taotronics additionally the cohens take a little bit longer than expected to turn on and off which is problematic because when you go to turn them off you trigger pairing at the same time right before turning it off so you can stake the vocal cue for pairing or turning it off and then let go of the button too early without powering them down Ive done that a lot and its something that was really annoying at first and its only over the last week or so that Ive actually gotten used to it on the cones next in terms of sound quality both are good neither is going to compete with bows at 300 price points but at this price point of around 100 theyre certainly better than I expected I would have to give an overall edge here to the coins they just sounded a little bit clearer in the treble then the taotronics did but both are certainly a little bit bass heavy so if you like listening to bass music this is probably pretty good another thing worth noting is that the Coens have a BT X so if you like to listen to high five music thats an advantage that youre definitely going to get out of the Coens whereas its not present in the taotronics now if youre just listening to Spotify right now and 2019 they dont have HiFi sound so youd be able to get away with either but if youre on a music service like title and youre paying for that additional five dollars a month in order to get the premium sound youre definitely going to want to go with the cohens another thing worth noting is the latency overall its better on the Coens there are only about a hundred and thirty milliseconds latency whereas the taotronics are closer to 230 so thats a big advantage to the poem I would have to say that you know its still Bluetooth I wouldnt expect to use them for gaming but if youre used to seeing a little bit of a mismatch in what you see when watching a movie on your laptop and what you hear youd be better off going with the Cohens then with the taotronics in terms of noise isolation so just looking at passive noise isolation what they cancel out when nothing is turned on here its very easy to say that the taotronics are better they block out a lot of sound just naturally whereas the Cohens are pretty much average in this category they dont block out a lot what that really means in real life though is that if youre listening to music at very low volume with the taotronics youd be safe to have somebody at the desk next to you talking and you wouldnt be able to hear anything whereas if theyre having a conversation next to you and the musics on really low with the Coens youll probably hear a little bit of their conversation its not a huge deal for me because I dont work in a really loud environment but if youre somebody who likes to commute and maybe youre on the subway and your whole point of getting noise cancelling headphones is to make sure that you block it out the taotronics are definitely better in this category in terms of active noise cancellation its really hard to do a direct comparison because the isolation is so much better on the taotronics having said that though if you just listen to the difference between having them turn on and turn off I would have to give an advantage here to the Cohens on cheap headphones with active noise cancellation you typically get this humming sound in the background that can be a little bit annoying when active noise cancellation is enabled thats more prominent on the taotronics its certainly not problematic but more prominent whereas with the Coens its hardly noticeable which is actually really nice at this price point and Im very happy with overall its not going to make a big difference if youre listening to music its just when you have nothing else playing or perhaps if youre listening to an audiobook that you would really notice that humming in the background additionally its worth noting that when you turn on active noise cancellation for either of these the equalization does change a little bit its not a huge deal when youre listening to music I could hardly notice it but if youre listening to an audiobook you can definitely tell that the sound better when active noise cancellation is turned off as opposed to turn upon overall both of these headphones are really good for the price point that theyre at the fact that you can get either of these for around 100 is pretty incredible the sound quality is good they have pretty good active noise cancellation and really theyre quite comfortable if you are somebody with larger ears though I would recommend going with the taotronics additionally if you are somebody who commutes on a subway or in a lab environment these would be good I personally work in an office where people are talking around me and the Cohens are perfectly good for that overall if you dont need either of the isolation or the larger ear fit I would recommend spending a little bit more money to get the Coens just because overall theyre more comfortable for me and I can wear them for three hours without any issue

hey whats up guys today were gonna do a review of the AKG and 60 NC wireless headphones Ive been using them for a couple of months now and Im gonna tell you what I like what I dont like and how much I think theyre worth hey guys first I want to apologize for missing the past couple of weeks but Im glad Im back and you guys know I got the a cage with a galaxy note 9 a couple of months ago and Ive been using them just have been basically my primary headphones so for pretty much everything when Im on conference calls at work at home when Im listening to music when Im watching TV or just watching YouTube listening to you to basically been using these headphones for a while now and first thing I want to talk about is that the overall design the headband and the ear cups theyre gonna be made of leather the headband is not the most comfortable one especially if you have long hair I feel like this headband is gonna be pulling your hair it doesnt have much of padding on the top and if you use them for the wallet for a while youre gonna feel like theres gonna be adding some friction and its gonna maybe hurt you a little bit over time when it comes to the ear cuffs this are going to be pretty pretty small so you have larger head or if you have large ears this may be pretty uncomfortable I personally I feel like these are probably one of the best headphones Id views so far I havent tried that many but for me they work just perfect on the sides you can have the markings so you know when you have your perfect feed you can get it to the right exact spot every single time I notice that if I just wear them randomly they will start hurting my ears but once I get them to the right position I can wear them for over two hours and I dont feel any discomfort that is just something to keep in mind overall the ear cups that some people have complained that they cap come off for them in the past Ive personally been using AKG for a couple of years now and theyve been working just fine I mean the ear cups have not come off on any of the headphones that I have I have the AKG fifty and those are also still holding up pretty good when it comes to the outer rings youre gonna have this chrome design with the black the the chrome is still holding up pretty good I bang them a few times and and I havent had that many scratches on them so overall quality I feel I feel are they holding pretty good even though they feel liberal plasticky but that may be something good because if this headphones are going to be pretty light which is something else that to consider if youre gonna be using this for the wall you dont want to have some headphones that are gonna haul down your head with a lot a lot of weight but again keep in mind that this may not be for everybody I noticed on the reviews seems like people that tend to have large hits that they dont dont like them a lot real quick lets talk about the buttons and some of the features so on the right cup youre gonna have on the top youre gonna have your volume rockers buttons are pretty clickable very easy to find theyre pretty separated to the audio track control and your actual sliding track to enable the Bluetooth and the noise cancellation feature little further down youre gonna have the microphone and youre gonna have your audio track slide and mechanism so this one thing to keep in mind a lot of report dont know this but this is gonna work to skip the track go to the next track or previous track but this also is a button so if you press on it its gonna pass play the song or is gonna answer the phone call or its gonna end the phone call so keep that in mind its an actual button itself further down youre gonna have the actual sliding button or sliding pad that its going to allow you to enable the Bluetooth and enable the noise cancellation feature another thing to keep in mind is once you enable the Bluetooth youre also enabling in the noise cancellation feature which is pretty much gonna eat your battery if youre not using them and another complaint that I have on this is that I always forget to turn them off so youre supposed to get about 15 hours of battery life I honestly havent been able to make it there because I always forget to turn them off it doesnt matter how much you try it I always forget so I have to charge them maybe every other day I probably end up using them for four to five hours before I have to charge them and thats because I always forget to turn them off and it seems like the Bluetooth and the nose canceling just stay on they continue using it but again I dont know that I was expecting this to just kind of turn off and stab using the battery life something that Im having medicine on myself you also have your LED indicator in the bottom that will let you know when you have to put it on and also will start blinking red when the battery is getting low and when youre charging them as well its gonna start is gonna let you know when its fully charged or when its charging also another thing to keep in mind is with some of the phones not every single phone is not likely to do this but you can actually check the battery level for example in the galaxy note 9 I can go to the options Im gonna have them connected it will tell me how much percentage I have left in the battery I believe their iPhones do a pretty good job of doing that but a lot of the other Android phones like the no date no they note forward they they dont have the capability I was expecting the Narayan or they to have that but my particular unit does not tell me that so I dont you guys let me know if youre able to get the know today to tell you the battery level on years further out lets move into the other ear cup so you got your audio jack which again youre gonna have those come with it with the cable but one side is gonna be the 25 millimeter audio jack output input and on the other side is going to be here or your regular 35 so youre not gonna be able to use just your average howdy jack that you have four other headphones too something to keep in mind and you also have your micro USB charging port with an LED indicator which I was talking about earlier where it will blink red and let you know when its charging or when the battery is getting low now going back to the idea cable youre gonna have the inline control basically its going to have another microphone here its going to allow you to use this when youre done having them connected to bluetooth and you dont have a button that its gonna give you some basic controls when it comes to the microphone quality I think that AKG have one of the best microphones are using my work conference calls I always have asked many people to give me their feedback and they always sound clear Im always able to use them for any call and I never had issues people understanding what Im saying also another thing that I like about these headphones is that when Im putting them away or they when I just leave them in the table they fall different ways you can either fold them sideways where they can easily sit on top of the table or when youre on the go you can just basically fold them in and they basically take in feeling pretty much any of your back set that you have if you can either put them in carrying pouch that it comes with or just throw them in your your backpack now when it comes to the audio quality these are not gonna be the best headphones when it comes to that bass a key Gs is known for not having bass headphones and all the headphones earphones that I used before those headphones will not have as much space theyre gonna do okay I mean if youre listening to a song in the house bass is not gonna sound bad but youre just not gonna get that basis based youre just getting like with the bit so thats what probably one of the things that you have to keep in mind when it comes to just overall sound quality just listening to all the music or just again just watching videos regular audio YouTube I think it does pretty good it sounds really clear and when it comes to the noise cancellation headphones I kind of have mixed feelings I know Im not an expert on headphones but these are my first noise cancellation headphones so theyre youre not gonna filter out all the noise 100 so I think if you want to get better headphones like Bose or some of the Sony ones that go over your ear that basically block most of the environment always these are not gonna do that these are going to go on your ears against our smaller ear but theyre gonna go on top of your ears and theyre gonna filter a lot of the noise but its not gonna go away completely and it does a pretty good job I mean if you are for example when Im sitting next to the AC unit its pretty loud but put them on turn on the noise cancellation feature and it just basically mellows down the nose you can still listen to it its loud mellow down which it doesnt bother you and and then it does how its supposed to work if you are in the Train if you are in an airplane or just outside on the street and theres a lot of noise now these headphones were originally selling for about 300 they sell between 150 to 300 dollars depending on worrying when you check I definitely dont recommend you pay more than 150 dollars for them I know their AKG a lot of times you paying for a brand and the quality is there that theyre supposed to last you a while and AKG is usually a consistent company that delivers from what they promise but I personally feel like they probably worth about 100 or thats something that Im much how much I will be willing to pay for them 150 dollars may be pushing it but if you check for example in offer up Facebook marketplace Ill let go youre gonna see that theres a lot of people selling these headphones and thats because many of them got them through the promotions with the Galaxy Note phone so and I noticed that some people have been selling them 400 and even less I saw them once going out for about 85 new in a box so keep an eye out there on them I mean theres gonna be people trying to ask 200 250 150 youre gonna notice that those people are not gonna sell them but if you just keep your eye on it and youre gonna be able to pick them off for about 100 at least thats what I have noticed here in Dallas but those were my thoughts about the AKG in headphones there be my primary headphones and theyre gonna continue to be luckily I got a massive gift with the Galaxy Note phone but Id love to hear what you have to say let me know if you have any questions in the comment section below lets have that conversation thank you for watching make sure you smash the like button discontent and Ill see you on the next one", "video_title": "What do I think of the AKG

Wireless I think this is the beats Wireless  I do not know the exact model on this one but customer bought it in because the charging port is not working hes not able to charge his headphones now were gonna be working with one side of the headphones we do not have to open both sides because the charging port is here the top part is glued to this part here so all we have to do is we just have to break the glue okay okay right there Im gonna take a minute to remove all the screws thats big bosses job to take apart the stuff but hes busy doing something else hi how are you alright alright whats going on were gonna remove this piece here and thats the charging port or the charging board where the charging port horizontal and we thinkin out like this so how many wives do we have soldered onto this board 1 2 3 4 5 we can disorder those cables but we have to mark where each one is going to its difficult working on this board if we do not desalter those wires first lets see if its possible its gonna be hard and look at this I do see issues with the port oh you see how its loose we do not know if the path is good or if the pad is broken off the board look at this all the pins on this yeah I think we are missing the pads from the board oh look at this we are missing this pad despite this this we are missing a lot of parts Music lets clean the rip pads from this book Music to secure that connector in place Im going to apply solder on the middle pad here and then well secure the legs from the back and well work on the front fence Music the port is solid in place to make it even more solid were gonna follow the legs from the back and then well come to the front and expose Music now we have to fix the front Music based on our initial inspection this pin does not connect anything we do not see any trace for that pin so we gotta leave it like this this one here were gonna have to somehow connect this pin with the area that we scratched here the same thing with the other one and the same thing with the other one this is a very small and tight area so lets see how were gonna get in there Im gonna free apply solder on to the ideas that we scratch and on to the pins so we can make the job easier and as you can see we can barely see the pins under that connector I have the board holder at an angle so we can see those pins Music and one more to go let me just clean up a bit so we can see what was done and everything is good and the connector is not going anywhere we secured it from the bottom of the connector we secured that from back of the board and those wires are not gonna have any stress on them because the connector is very solid on the board Music okay and the job is done lets go over this one more time you have the right here we have between here we have the right here we have the black here and we have the copper here the copper is a little bit high maybe we can lower it down a bit just to make everything look nice and tidy very good very nice very nice Music and look at that we can see the light here its being charged right now and the charging rate is 053 awesome lets play one of our videos and test Im pointing the microphone on to the last size of that phone and now were gonna point it at the right side she tried to fix it then she pushed it in even more and now she cannot pass him awesome everything is working were gonna call the customer to come and pick up the headphones are being charged right now were gonna have to glue this piece here and thats it I hope you enjoyed this video dont forget to Like and

brandnew AKG headphones here this is a 10200 wireless headphones if that focuses lets see lets see come on Sony nevermind you guys would see more about it in a second for us lets take a look at whats inside a box so you guys will know what to expect if youre looking to buy one of these and then Ill talk you through my experience with it its got all the things all the specs for it to excel really well but there are tiny little niggles here in there that Ive found when using it that to be honest should not be asking used to but well talk you through that in a second lets check it out so when you take it outside of the box you get everything you need to get started like a cable to charge it its there you got a case as well you got loads of light here tips and buds so that you can get the perfect fitting for your hair drums so the one that usually comes with earphones and general fits in my tears with no problem so I didnt have to change it at all but its very easy to swap over including the shark fin that goes inside you here kind of thing to keep it secure so its very easy to change and so on so this is this art in here and what you notice straight away is youve got an inline control and on this inline control you have your microphone a function button the ports to charge it its a micro USB again this is something that I expected that AKG Samsung Harman whoever would opt it updated his by that to a USB see it shed be phasing out by now you got the volume control which gonna also be used for changing tracks you got the starts and stop and and start answer phone call button and so on and you got this LED indicator lights there as well so you can see when its pairing and so on and youve got microphone like I said already and a flap that covers the ports for charging as well what I really like about the cable the the strap here is covered in fabric and you can adjust it and then tie accordingly around the back of your neck so then it keeps it nice and secure so if youre gonna be using it for sports this is very good for that again my experience so far its been good for making phone calls Audio is excellent bass is good something I expected from AKG anyway so youve got a good audio bass levels are good and mids are good and also the troubles are good as well and you dont really get outside noise as such as well even though theyre not noise cancelling so again thats a bonus for someone looking for something like this for training or just using everyday youve got 20 Hertz to 20 kilohertz frequency response again really for audio youve got eight hours of battery with speed charge as well so you can really you can charge it up quickly so with eight hours once Ive been using this Ive got just around seven hours out of it thats what Im using it all day long in the office and out and about and making phone calls and so on and to charge it you can charge it quickly within so you get 15 15 minutes of charge will give you an hours use and that is very true this is something they quoted and thats very true with Bluetooth it supports aptX and AAC technology so really good you can use voice a system with this is compatible with bixby google assistant and anything else that you use on your phone if using it with an iPhone you can use the Kinect Siri as well which is really good its available in black its also available in green and blue Im not sure what color this is exactly ugh go for black hair because its got tiny hints here and there of green as well which are quite liked and the fabric is very comfortable on the neck even when youre sweating it doesnt really affect you as such for those interested in its battery size and this is 110 million power battery in there again will last you up to eight hours depending on your usage pairing is very simple press and hold the middle button there to start pairing it pair with your phone you can pair with multiple devices and as combination accuser you can press to switch between devices as well which can come in very handy for someone like me who uses more than one devices youve also got this magnetic attachment here so if you drop you around you wrap it around your neck attach it like so and you can drop it and its easy to go so you can store it around your neck cannot worry about losing it one thing I didnt like about that though is even once youve got this like that it doesnt stop the audio it doesnt go into standby mode it doesnt do anything so youre most likely to end up doing and thinking is going into standby and then end up running up the battery if you dont stop your music or disconnect from your device which is something that I really really found fire and thats a bit worrying on this device but besides that audio is good the design is excellent I love how it fits as well this just feels premium you set you back about 129 pounds in the UK Im not sure anywhere else around the world all the availability sedessa do check on samsungs website where you can purchase this anyway guys thats it for the AKG end 200 let me know what you think one more thing I didnt mention is the app the AKG app on the app of Google Play Store wasnt compatible with this it wasnt um then what maybe theyll introduce something where you can actually control this a little bit and modify the buttons and so when that kind of stuff but yes let me know

wireless headphones there always seems to be some kind of compromise that we have to make and usually that compromises in the sound Department well that ends today with the collaboration from thx and drop the Panda headphones Music whats a gossipy to here today were gonna be talking about the drop and thx collaboration they panda headphones Im gonna give you guys my thoughts today the rundown on some of the features that I think are really important the sound profiles and all that good stuff so lets jump into it so right now on IndieGoGo I believe these are three hundred and twenty dollars in the future though I believe theyre gonna raise the retail price to four hundred dollars and later Ill give you my thoughts on the pricing and if its worth it so in the box youre going to get the case which feels great its always nice some companies provide that protection for your headphones for travel upon opening the case youll see the headphones in all black and when light hits these headphones it hits differently they look super sleek also in the case they have this little compartment with a little flap that opens and then you can get to the 35 millimeter cable and USBC charger now these do have an adjustable headband I do wish theres more clicks though it seems a little bit short and you guys out there with big heads you might be in trouble the headband feels really sturdy though it feels like youre getting the quality product here the headband has rubber up top and it feels comfortable when its on top of your head the ear cuffs level up and down and left to right to give you the best fit for you the ear cuffs feel great on your ears they dont get too hot they also have this memory foam that just feels so so nice against your skin and it also gives you a proper seal since these are a closed back headphone and they do block out a ton of noise so if youre somebody that takes public transportation or you fly a lot these are going to be a great companion for you because it just block out so much noise even without noise cancellation like I can have music in my room blaring or twitch blaring you know people are talking and yelling over the mic and it just blocks out all of that I just played my music the only reason why I knew my music was playing was because my arm started to rumble on my desk while I was listening to these so on the actual headphones they have like I said a 35 millimeter jack in here so if you wanna plug this directly to your phone or another source like a plane you can do that also on the other side youre going to have the USB port for charging so another feature of this headphone that I really love is the media control now all you have to do is hit it up or down that controls the volume left and right skips tracks theres no more trying to double tap or triple tap to go forward and backwards its supereasy it works in one click and youre good to go and if you press it down you can pause or play your song really really easy system to use I actually love this over the touch controls of the 1000 X and three is because this one you know when youre going forward or backwards or up and down sometimes the 1000 X and three is it doesnt register what youre pressing alright so lets test the sound leakage right now Im gonna put these on I have the volume at zero on my phone and Im gonna raise it to a hundred percent to see if you guys can hear it so here we go okay were at a hundred now this is 50 this is 75 so Im gonna check the footage and see how much leakage there was but you guys can determine if that is good for you or not so these headphones are using bluetooth 50 and is using LD AC technology from Sony now what that means is you get a high bitrate over Bluetooth giving you the best sound quality possible so they really didnt skimp out on the quality of these headphones so before we get into the sound of these headphones lets take a look at the dual microphones Im gonna drop a sound test for you guys right about now so this is a test of the dual microphones on the Panda headphones now usually with headphones of this type they dont really focus too much on the microphones and I have to say that these headphones are no different its a little bit echoey but it will get the job done if you just wanted to take that phone call here and there in between your music listening but I wouldnt be taking any conference calls or business calls on these headphones just kind of sounds a little bit distorted in my opinion so these headphones can run for about 30 hours thats about what the Sony 1000x m3s are which I consider the best wireless headphones at the moment well maybe not anymore now most headphones that youre gonna find are gonna be dynamic driver headphone and those are subject to all sorts of distortion but with planar magnetic headphones that gets rid of a lot of the distortion that you might find by using these ribbons now usually youre gonna find these planar and magnetic drivers on the higher end headphones but guys drop has to decide to put them on the pandas and let me tell you guys they use every millimeter of these 55 millimeter playing our magnetic drivers the sound stage is what impressed me the most youll be hearing instruments in the top bottom right left corners of these headphones every they use every inch of these headphones its absolutely absurd that they were able to put this kind of soundstage in separation into a closed back headphone its almost like you know the people responsible for surround sound made these headphones hmm speaking of which this has THX triplea technology in it and this reduces distortion by twenty to a hundred times insane this is currently what theyre calling the worlds lowest distortion in any headphone another thing that I love about these headphones that kind of fixes some of the other issues that other wireless headphones have is the volume weve all been there weve been listening to a live set like an EDM live set and the levels just dont get high enough and you cant really feel your music I was able to turn up my music maybe its about 75 and I already felt like they were too loud thats how loud these gift they get insanely laughs up in there where our previous wireless headphones theyll get to a point where its like it starts a beeping is that deep like you cant go past a certain point you will never hit that point with the pen another thing that I love about these headphones is theres no gimmicks here everything comes from those drivers theres no extra haptic feedback happening in the background your rumbling from the bass and all the percussions and stuff is coming straight from these headphones straight from the source is organic and it feels and sounds so nice so when the homie bass attack was in town he actually showed me his pair of pandas when I tried them the first thing that happened was the mids slapped me in the face the vocals the bass was there but the vocals with a star of the show and you guys know me Im a sucker for vocal so these headphones were right up my alley when I loved about it is everything feels so layered sometimes what happens with these gimmicky bass headphones is that the bass actually fails the vocals and the highs and actually kind of overpowers two tracks these keep everything intact allowing the tracks to shine in their own way and not trying to force something upon the track you guys know the first track that I had to try with these was that II oh man that was horrible but that rowdy rich the box sounds incredible on this head like I just had it on repeat playing again and again this headphone is super addictive to listen to not only is this good for rap but this is also good for EDM because of all that soundstage youll be hearing sounds in every corner of the headphone like Im before not only that it also shines because of that reason in classical music I dont think just because its bass heavy that it just ruins all classical music it does a very good job of separating all the instruments that you want to hear so if youre feeling fancy you want to listen to some classical music you can do those with these headphones in terms of sound quality in my opinion nothing comes close to these in the wireless realm not the P X is not the 1000 X and 3 is not the boses these are the ones you want if youre an audiophile and it doesnt stop there it just doesnt have to be compared to wireless headphones for any pair of headphones these are a good pair of headphones by any standard so with all these features drop is calling this the 3 P signal path because it combines that high bandwidth Bluetooth LD AC codec that zero distortion with a thx Triple A amplifier inside and the phase corrector playing our ribbon drivers this summit of they put the best of the best into these headphones now these do have that same distinct flavor that all planar magnetic head phones have which is theyre a little bit on the dark richer side and Im here for it amazing headphone definitely go back this up on IndieGoGo so you can get a deal on it for 320 bucks this is an easy cop for me especially if you are commuting if youre flying or even if you just want to listen to this in your home handsfree wireless free this is it chief alright guys its been your boy bt dont forget to like share comment and subscribe and I will see you in

Captions": " all right welcome to a longterm review of the Bose sound sport wireless headphones the color that I have here is aqua Ive used them for nearly two years and so I guess thats a good time to do a very longterm review video for people who like to keep their stuff for a long time and then are looking for quality stuff that actually lasts a long time two years is a long time these days  especially for stuff like these for tech that go obsolete every other month you see new releases but both somehow stands up because of its quality so lets talk about whats good first and then theyll get whats not good and lets get to a final verdict on and the earphones itself so whats good right away you know both theyre really good sounding your buds they have their own equalizer settings but they call something else they have a term for it but you dont have a separate equalizer unless you have an equalizer app on the phone acceptable as rapala phone but they sound really really good without any changes so number one they sound awesome number two the fit is actually pretty good so for someone who goes to work out and four runs I use it mainly for a running I used to use them for workouts as well on a daily basis but right now I have a have some other pair of earbuds that I use for gym and but for running though these are really good and the secure fit that the post your headphones come with these ones actually go in your ear pretty good they have three sizes and I think most people well for them itll fit them properly so these fit really well for running outside running or on the treadmill and never come off until or unless you have water going in there because youre sweating a lot but thats thats the thats thats the true situation for every other earbuds on the market so thats one good second good thing third good thing the quality does the quality of the year buds itself for two years of use you they havent changed much except there are some things I lost by using them really rough and then there are some things that I changed here the basic quality of the earbuds and the sound quality remains the same so I dont see any disadvantages with that the sound quality remaining the same I would say 99 close to whatever well it still does since I bought it but theyre pretty good so thats number three number four do I even have them before number four I would say the point right now the advantage of the Pro for these headphones or theyre going for a really less low price they even dip to sometimes one twenty Canadian which means you probably get it for 99 USD sometimes on this number right now theyre going from 150 Canadian which would equate to around 119 USD so the price itself I think is a really good Pro here so if youre thinking of getting them right now even though its been 2 years since these released I still think its a good buy for the price for the sound for the fit and for the quality that bose offers now lets go to some disadvantages on this item so the number one disadvantage of this item is theyre a little bit on the heavier end so when you have it in the ear and youre running a really high pace they seem to jiggle around a little bit not too much a little bit they dont come off but you still have that feeling where you know you have something in ears thats a little bit heavy and you might feel like theyre coming off but again it has a secure fit right here for the ears plus you can clip this see I see that I used a plastic Ill get to the disadvantage second this plastic goes onto your shirt or your vest that youre wearing and so there wont really fall off thats actually an advantage should be honest wire around them and then number two there are some pieces that are falling off right now especially after 2 years of use I dont know if its about as a disadvantage but definitely if youre wanting to use it for more than a year and a half you would see some other things fall off first thing first again the second disadvantage I would say is you see here Id put some glue on there though the rubber where it to the plastic after one year it started coming off a little bit because you use this button quite so often you keep on hitting it and the glue comes off a little bit easy and you see it theres also something else here if I touch it it goes down so the glue thats coming off here as well so thats one of the gripes but Im not really surprised after two years of use that its coming off but theyre still functioning even though I have a lot of sweat it doesnt really seem to affect it you could use some glue and stick this to take these ends off the super glue stuff you can stick these ends off and I think you should be fine and then there are other items that come off like these the both logo ones one of one of it came off I think that after I had had it thrown around for a while after using it renewed roughly thats being a little bit harsh on both but I think they I think it still functions properly well thats thats one of the gripes I will if Im really nitpicking thats one of the gripes that some things are starting to fall off or come off so other than that the really minor disadvantage is at the clip that comes with bows actually if youre sweating and if theres theres liquid in it this clip will come off of the wire itself and if youre doing heavy lifting like lets say bench press and youre sleeping Bob you know youre youre laying down position youre doing a flat bench press you might press against this and this might break off and it happened to me once and I ordered two of these again from from boss and this is this this is the second thing that Im using yeah but theyre all as well but you see theres a small or tiny crack here I dont know if you can see it very well try to focus on here but theres a crack I think this might be coming off in the next few months as well but thats the great if youre sweating this will come off and then if youre doing bench presses have you bench presses or have you double press then this will start to crack so thats something to notify and then you see another thing that just came off is is this item right here so its supposed to attach right here and just came off the other side its its still there but anyway those are the disadvantages from reading me picking what for the price it currently is when I bought them theyre really expensive but right now for the price the value is very good so I would say a thumbs up for this one if youre trained thinking of buying them especially at the price right now wait for the Black Friday youd see them dead 200 USD or 129 years Canadian and so Id say thats a really good buy there you go guys thats a review please be sure to LIKE and subscribe and

offers to try inexpensive Bluetooth wireless over the ear headphones all the time and I used to jump on those and then I got to a point where these are all starting to sound the same and they dont sound good at all so when the company ear fund wanted me to try out their new earphone wave I was hesitant at first but the thing I did remember was when I tried the earphone free which is their true Wireless earbud I was really impressed what they were able to do for 50 bucks so I was also wondering were they able to do the same thing for 50 dollars with a pair of wireless overtheear headphones so today were gonna look at the earphone wave that only costs 50 bucks and right now on Amazon even has a 20 off coupon so you can pick them up for frde now guys one thing I do want to point out is ear fun also wanted to do a giveaway for you guys that is going on right now all the way till September 24th theyre going to give away two pairs of these but all of that information is in the description so lets go ahead and check out some of the features and whats inside the box now speaking of the box the first thing I want to point out is the packaging is actually pretty similar to Sonys 1000x m3s like when you slide the Box out it has the flap that goes over the hard case which also surprised me the fact that it came with a hard case and a pretty nice one even though the case itself is really thick its gonna take up a lot of space at your bag but it is pretty compact the headphones themselves followed up very nicely inside of them and it even has a compartment thats holding your threeandahalf millimeter cable that it comes with and the dreaded microUSB cable which Im going to try to look past because these are so inexpensive but again guys just include a USB C and then I wont even have to bring it up but speaking of the USB cable lets go ahead and talk about the battery the battery life on these are 40 hours which to me is really impressive especially considering like some of the bigger brands even the Sennheisers that I reviewed yesterday thats a 400 pair of headphones and youre getting 17 hours of use so getting 40 is really impressive and on top of that if you pick them up and theyre dead a tenminute charge will give you two hours of use and I always welcome that because I cant tell you how many times I pick up a pair of headphones and theyre dead now as far as the design and everything on the headphones the whole overall presentation is just simple its not trying to do too much the outside is a matte black its just plastic but it feels very smooth which does mean it also picks up a lot of fingerprints it has the aluminum slider inside so as far as finding the right adjustment you have lines as well to be able to match up on both sides now one concern I will say concern is they feel maybe even too light at times where it feels like they could be fragile now I can say that I could Ive been able to bend these and extend these and theyre fun but I think build quality is something I maybe would have liked to have seen a little more weight on but the headband has actually some pretty nice padding but again these are so light that they could have left off the padding and you probably wouldnt have known but the padding on the ear cups they are very deep and very soft and squishy but thats like the best way to describe it but when theyre on your head they dont have like that tight clamping force they really do just kind of give way and feel so soft around your ears that was one of my favorite parts is how soft the ear pads were on these now again like I said as far as being simple it does have their logo and just like a chrome ring on both sides of the ear cups but for the most part this is a very simple looking design now one thing that I absolutely do not like is the way they did the charging port on the headphones it has this little flap that covers them I just think it looks cheap I think its something that eventually is gonna break off and its just inconvenient to have to kind of pull that thing off to charge the headphones now on the left hand side you do have the input for the headphone cable and then back on the right side is where all of your controls are located so play pause skip volume up and down everything is on the headphones themselves so one of the other things they added a noise rejecting microphone so for you guys that are on the go and like to take phone calls just by keeping your headphones on its doing a pretty decent job but you guys can go ahead and listen to a test here alright guys so here is a mic test of the earphone wave this is just to show you what it would sound like if you were taking phone calls alright and heres the microphone with a crowd noise being played in the background just so you know what it would sound like if you were in a restaurant bar or a coffee shop so now I think what is the most important part is the sound I will say that I wont spend any money on something that just doesnt sound good like features and build quality and all that stuff is great but it really doesnt mean much if it sounds awful and again thats where I go back to most of those inexpensive Bluetooth headphones just sound like youre underwater they just theres something about them that sounds muffled and congested and they usually just dont handle bass very well and thats why I was really surprised with these I was surprised in the fact that one it had a very nice bass presence theres tons of base in these headphones but they were still able to keep them tight and clean its not one of those that distorts which is another problem with most inexpensive headphones I was able to turn these up really loud and there was no distortion also with the treble it was very bright very clean everything just about these had a very nice presence but I still feel like the mids were pulled back too much I felt like in certain songs or in certain genres I just would have liked to have had the mids boosted a little bit more I dont like to ever feel like the vocals are trying to battle it out with the rest of the sound and just depending on what it was I was listening to I felt like at times I was doing that with these but again that still me trying to compare this with very expensive headphones in fact the sound signature on these are very very similar to the beats solo threes like really similar in fact that I would be kind of surprised if this isnt the same driver thats in the beats solo threes that they also shoved in the earphone weight so even if you want to look at it like that you can compare a 250 or 300 pair headphones  a pair of 50 and right now even 40 pair of headphones you see where Im coming from but as far as the cons yea it picks up a lot of fingerprints I really hate that little flap I would have liked to have seen maybe a little more weight in the headphones just so it makes you feel better about bending them and knowing that you can kind of throw them around a little bit and theyll be okay and then in my opinion they needed to bump the mids up just a little I think the features I think the nice case the battery life and the sound that youre getting is worth way over the 50 price tag so guys that is my video on the ear fun wave wireless bluetooth headphones if you guys are interested like I said there is a giveaway thats going on to the 24th where you guys have a chance to win two pairs but all that info is in the description so thank you guys so much for checking out this video thank you so much for

offers to try inexpensive Bluetooth wireless over the ear headphones all the time and I used to jump on those and then I got to a point where these are all starting to sound the same and they dont sound good at all so when the company ear fund wanted me to try out their new earphone wave I was hesitant at first but the thing I did remember was when I tried the earphone free which is their true Wireless earbud I was really impressed what they were able to do for 50 bucks so I was also wondering were they able to do the same thing for 50 dollars with a pair of wireless overtheear headphones so today were gonna look at the earphone wave that only costs 50 bucks and right now on Amazon even has a 20 off coupon so you can pick them up for frde now guys one thing I do want to point out is ear fun also wanted to do a giveaway for you guys that is going on right now all the way till September 24th theyre going to give away two pairs of these but all of that information is in the description so lets go ahead and check out some of the features and whats inside the box now speaking of the box the first thing I want to point out is the packaging is actually pretty similar to Sonys 1000x m3s like when you slide the Box out it has the flap that goes over the hard case which also surprised me the fact that it came with a hard case and a pretty nice one even though the case itself is really thick its gonna take up a lot of space at your bag but it is pretty compact the headphones themselves followed up very nicely inside of them and it even has a compartment thats holding your threeandahalf millimeter cable that it comes with and the dreaded microUSB cable which Im going to try to look past because these are so inexpensive but again guys just include a USB C and then I wont even have to bring it up but speaking of the USB cable lets go ahead and talk about the battery the battery life on these are 40 hours which to me is really impressive especially considering like some of the bigger brands even the Sennheisers that I reviewed yesterday thats a 400 pair of headphones and youre getting 17 hours of use so getting 40 is really impressive and on top of that if you pick them up and theyre dead a tenminute charge will give you two hours of use and I always welcome that because I cant tell you how many times I pick up a pair of headphones and theyre dead now as far as the design and everything on the headphones the whole overall presentation is just simple its not trying to do too much the outside is a matte black its just plastic but it feels very smooth which does mean it also picks up a lot of fingerprints it has the aluminum slider inside so as far as finding the right adjustment you have lines as well to be able to match up on both sides now one concern I will say concern is they feel maybe even too light at times where it feels like they could be fragile now I can say that I could Ive been able to bend these and extend these and theyre fun but I think build quality is something I maybe would have liked to have seen a little more weight on but the headband has actually some pretty nice padding but again these are so light that they could have left off the padding and you probably wouldnt have known but the padding on the ear cups they are very deep and very soft and squishy but thats like the best way to describe it but when theyre on your head they dont have like that tight clamping force they really do just kind of give way and feel so soft around your ears that was one of my favorite parts is how soft the ear

"video_id": "3FIKwLLdGAE", "Closed Captions": " hey guys welcome to another gaging gadgets review video in this video we have some wireless Bluetooth earbuds from ball tune these earbuds feature 16 hours of battery life they also have bluetooth 50 and theyre ipx7 sweat proof and water resistant all that for about 22 dollars using the available coupon so check the link in the description to find that price lets go ahead and open them up and check them out they come in a nice cardboard box and I like that because you can recycle it well Im getting these open just want to thank Bolton for sending me these headphones so I could test them thank you very much alright so it looks like we have another flap to open on top we have some support information the actual headphones right here Ill put them aside see what else is in the box we have some spare earbud tips as well as your wings a very small charging cable which is standard USB to microUSB a carrying case that is really nice has some good protection to it this is similar to the cases that are provided by anchor and then finally we have a users manual Ill go ahead and get the headphones out of the bag so right off the bat you can see that they have a magnetic design really cool I love when headphones have that it makes it much easier to use one at a time or to simply just wrap them around your neck when youre not using them come with some plastic that protects them so the earbud here seems to be metal on the outside and its kind of a shiny metal so itll be a little bit flashy then its a plastic going on to two different pieces that can be removed and changed on the earbud so first you have the earbud tip and this is all a very soft material it feels like rubber and then you have the ear wing right here and this goes inside your ear lobe to ensure that the earbud is stabilized so really you have these two very soft rubbers thatll fit in your ear and hopefully be nice and comfortable these can all be changed out with the different sizes that were provided in this bag each earbud here has a right and left indicator located on the ear wing you can see that L right there and the R right there and there are no buttons or anything like that located on the actual earbuds the buttons are all going to be down the cable on the little dongle here so as you can see you have three buttons the middle is going to be a multi functional button that will be used to pause and play audio you can also turn on and turn off the headphones with this button as well as answer and hang up on phone calls then you have a plus and a minus button this will be the volume control as well as track control and then it looks like you have a little LED that kind of just provide the status of the earbuds so if theyre in pairing mode if theyre on and then on the side of the dongle you have a micro USB connector for charging the earbuds and it has this little rubber gasket to ensure that they are sweat proof the dongle also has a nice bull tune logo on the back pretty cool the cable is a very soft material so I dont think youll have any issues with this rubbing on your skin if you wear it behind your head or on the back of your neck anything like that it also is flat so usually that means that they do not tangle very easily so really thats it on the Bolton earbuds you have the dongle with the controls you have the magnetic design and then the two removable pieces on each earbud now that weve taken a closer look at the Bolton earbuds lets go ahead and turn them on and then well get them paired with my phone so Ill turn them on and put them in pairing mode by just holding down the power button until we see the blue and red light blinking all right theyre in pairing mode they come up by phone as Bolton BTB H 0 0 1 and were connected as you can see they came fully charged which is always a nice touch alright so as you can see Im currently wearing the Bolton earbuds right here and all the audio youre hearing right now is coming from the microphone located on the dongle right here so hopefully this will give you a good idea of what the microphone sounds like if youre gonna be placing calls with these or if youre going to be connecting them to a computer or game console or in game chat or discord additionally I hope this gives you a good idea of what they look like Warren one thing I definitely like about the magnetic design is that it makes it really easy to wear only one at a time because you can take one out and then connect it to the other one via the magnet and you still have the usage of the microphone if you want to if you want to be on a call or you can just listen to music and you still have one ear open to anybody around you that wants to talk to you alright so as you just heard the microphone on the Bolton earbuds was actually extremely high quality I would say youd have no problem placing calls with these and it would actually be okay to use this in conference calls or in game chat if youre going to be using this with a console or on your PC now additionally I also like the audio quality out of these I found it to be extremely clear and the highs and the mids came through very powerfully with no tininess at all the lows while the bass was a little bit lacking it was still there and it was an enjoyable listening experience so really there was no problem and the listening experience was very enjoyable I also found no issues when I was watching YouTube or anything on my phone there was no problem with the audio being out of sync with the video the Bluetooth range is about 30 feet which is pretty normal for Bluetooth and you can actually sync to different devices at the same time now you only hear one device at a time but as soon as one goes silent and you start playing another one itll start playing it through the earbuds so very cool how seamless that was and how well it worked the dongle right here works very well the microphone was obviously very good but the buttons are very responsive its easy to find it because its hanging down right near your face and the LED is very easy to see its very easy to see if theyre on and if youve left them on so you know have to worry about draining down your battery there either and then lastly I really like the magnetic design like I showed you in the video its really cool to be able to wear one at a time and still use the microphone so if you wanted to be on a call and still be able to have some awareness around you by having just one earbud in you do have that option I also found them to be extremely comfortable like I said you have the rubber on the earbud you also have the rubber on the piece that goes inside the earlobe so its very soft does not bother you after youve been wearing it for a long period of time such as a couple hours so really I wasnt able to find a lot of negatives with these maybe just look at lacking a little bit when youre listening to more bass dependent music but like I said it was not that big of a problem and on top of all that I think they have a really good looking design so they look great when youre wearing them so those are the Bolton Bluetooth earbuds if youve any questions about this device leave a comment below Ill get back to you as soon as I can Im going to add an Amazon affiliate link to the description below so you

"DfBum4pBdmA", "Closed Captions": " welcome to be tech this is david this video is sponsored by direct mobile so check out their deals at direct mobile skoda at UK so welcome to my review of the adidas sport headphones now there are two sets of added us headphones to choose from you can have the inear type or the overtheair type theyre both designed for your workout and Im going to do a separate video about the earbuds because both of these really do sound great and they both deserve a separate video but for now this one is going to be about the overtheair headphones now these set of headphones will set you back about 140 pounds and I think it is safe to say that most people would assume that adidas branded set of headphones are just gonna be pretty bogstandard when it comes to the engineering itself and the style would be the only thing that they really got going but this is more of a collaboration analyst have clearly done the styling but the headphones themselves are made by a Swedish company called the South who are known for producing high quality audio products I think I so clearly styled these to go with their primeknit range even the unboxing experience is kind of like unboxing a pair of trainers with this paper wrapping and yes since Ive got these headphones I have kind of been thinking about investing in a pair now to give them their full name these are the adidas our PTO ones and with these were getting up to 40 hours of playback time which is a good few days of hard use and on top of that superfast USB typec charging these headphones are extremely lightweight and comfortable which is probably thanks to the unusual knitted woolen material wrapped around the tubular frame I think that this star will not appeal to everyone its definitely a street kind of look but it definitely works for me and its not too bulky the material is removable and washable thankfully as it is bound to get dirty fairly quickly the only reservation I have about the fabric is that it might start to fray and bubble over time but at least if it does you know that your crown will be able to knit you a new one if it really is a lot to like about these headphones its just theyre very well made even though you you might think that theyre not judging from the material when you get them in your hand they do feel the good quality even though theyre quite light the tubular frame is made from us quite a nice matte finish plastic and theres a ridged rubber band that goes inside of the headband that has the added s logo on one side if you look on it in a band theres a little time telling you which one is left and which one is right and theyre easily adjustable by just pushing the cups up and down these are definitely a fullyloaded self can I do like the control system on the right cup there is a little joystick you can push it up or down to control the volume push it in to start or stop the music or push it left and right to skip tracks I find the sound quality to be excellent rich and nuanced plenty of bass but not too much they it buries everything else you get clear midrange and sharp tops as well its just all around a really nice rich and clear sound bluetooth 50 gives a strong connection it will be available straight away in your Bluetooth menu but if you download the added s app you get a few different sound profiles as well as access to a graphic equalizer to create your own as well as the joystick type control on the right Cup on the left cup there is an action button within the app you can customize what functions you want to add to the action button and you can also connect up your Spotify account to get instant access to your selected playlists customize it how you want Ive got the single press to activate voice assistant and double press and triple press to access my Spotify playlist I find out when making calls with these headphones although the voice comes through crystal clay you cant really fault it at all I cant really hear myself talk so I feel like Im showering when I have them on which I probably am but thats probably more mindful than the headphones even my dad says that the call comes through crystal clear when I speak to him and hes always complaining about the quality of the phone line these are ipx4 rated so you wont have no problems with them getting soaked in sweat or if youre ever caught in the rain and it s really have capital bases here the only one feature thats missing is passthrough audio but you can find that feature in the in air version of these which Ill be doing a review of very soon or if youre watching this in a few days is up on the channel great but overall I really love these headphones Ive got quite a few different pairs in for review at the moment but I keep going back to these ones because of the sound quality they just sound amazing on top of it they look really good looks great sounds great super fast charging from just five minutes charging you can get a good couple of hours play from this if you were thinking about buying these but you was a little bit worried that because theyre by adding tasks theyre not going to sound very good well taken from me these are a very nice set of headphones and come highly recommended I have to say my only reservation weeks headphones is probably the thing that is most attractive about and thats the material that theyve used around it yeah it does look great now but Im worried how its gonna look in six months times a years time ya know its washable Im just conscious that its not going to look as good as it does when it was new and I always seem to have that in the back of my mind and Im very careful with them even though they are quite sturdy you are able to twist that tube the frame quite easily and it just always pops back to its normal shape other than that these are great and Im really enjoying using before I go I want to tell you about the Barrett Mobiles website it really is a

phone one of which was the lack of the headphone jack which since iPhone 7 apples taken out of your phones now theres been a lot of controversy over that and Apples released a lot of dongles but I personally are not funds that I think theyre just hockey fan and so I decided since I was in a meeting I flew Yacktman 8 or X as the personal one for the next year so hey lets invest in Wireless next one so I did a little bit of research turns out Apple is releasing brand new studios needless to say I go to my hands and song installed it all further ado present and all new Beats Studio 3 wireless headphones Music all right so just looking at the blocks it looks pretty nice this is of course the special edition box that uses eyes as I mentioned earlier to beat studio three Wireless these actually come in six different colors I do have the shadow gray hair right now but this also comes in blue porcelain rose matte black white and red but I personally like the shadow great the best so thats what I have here so looking around the box so just a couple of features listed on the back which Ill be talking about in a sec and picture of the beat so just slightly in the sky gold beats logo right there so Im gonna go ahead and open it up and yeah we do see the case right here which comes with these headphones looks pretty nice just gonna go through the rest of the ball this is the fast fuel charge linen cord so the cool thing about this is ten minutes of charge actually gets you three hours of playback which is really cool if you you know have your headphones dead and youre in order to get some just looking through the rest of the clocks we of course have the three millimeter headphone cord here which isnt going to be too useful if you have the iPhone a drivein acts of course but for like other phone users like Samsung or even like the laptops this could come in very handy so Im just gonna set that aside also and not really sure what this is looks like some clip of some sort so Im just gonna set that aside so moving the box this side now focus on the actual headphones well this case looks really nice and most like youre gonna use this a lot wow these look really nice I was actually worried at first they might be tad bit too big but honestly they look really nice theres a sticker here which Im just gonna peel off thank you ladies and gentlemen the allnew Beats Studio 3 Wireless head the shadow recolor of course looks very nice fluent beats clean D we designed this a little bit so I didnt see overall build looks a lot nicer and Mike looks really smooth and shiny today of course maintain the design over here that lets you play by hidden this and you know you can go volume up volume down by doing that or changing tracks by clicking left and right so that looks nice Ill stick over here which Im just going to take off the charging ports right here the port of course if you choose to use a wired connection for this so just talking about the features of this as pure ENC which I mentioned earlier which is actually pure active noise cancellation so that actually cancels out blocks out a lot of external noise whos done a really good job at this this year especially with the addition of the w1 chip which is also youre not allowing to connect really quickly to your devices so long as theyre running on newer iOS versions of course people love other non Apple phones like androids or whatever of course gonna have to go through the traditional process of pairing headphones really like Bluetooth settings and whatnot so what else is that tell me on fascicle charge which gives you three hours of playback from just 10 minutes or charges I mentioned earlier it also features realtime audio calibration to improve your listening so Bates actually claims these will have 22 hours of battery life so actually turn off the ante gives you more listening alright so just moving to the pairing process I did mention earlier that these headphones actually have apples neww on chipping off the big things with that actually is um parent so basically all you need to do is actually just turn the Bluetooth on your phone and then theres a power button right here and then all you need to do is just hold that to turn the headphones on and it automatically pops up on your screen all you do is hit connect and that should be it so now you can see its connected to the Beats Studio threes and yeah you can go ahead and listen Im just gonna move on says listen experience and also saying out these actually fit so Mike is gonna put these on now Ive had a bit of a reservation on how they might actually fit just because theyre a bit bigger than you know youre a regular headphones what I like the solos for instance so Im kind of curious to see how it fits Im just going to go ahead and listen to a song chest up you know the sound quality is great the one small thing Im going to mention though is theyre pretty big so that it might just be something you want to pay attention to before actually bind these to actually make sure they fit well those of you wondering these are actually gonna set you back 399 here in Canada so if youre not that price maybe I have to see theyre pretty worth that you know the quality like I just said is really good and the fits nice long thanks for watching guys if yall gonna already subscribed feel free to do so right now and Ill see you guys Music push me to the edge all my friends are dead push me to the edge all my friends are dead push me to this all my friends are dead", "video_title": "Beats

Kareem from DJ booth net and Im hearing aloud to give you guys a quick review video of the new III TM a to HD Wireless and HD wired over the ear headphones so what we have here is the newest addition of the tma2 headphones from III we also reviewed the TMA ones years ago then we reviewed the original tma2 s and what the tma2 is all around is a modular style headphone meaning you can customize these to exactly how you want them you can change the headband for different materials that you see fit you can also change the different cables if you want to coiled cable professional cables or if you want like a smart phone cable they have all of those options here for you you can also change the ear cups themselves so the ear pads either sit right on the ear like these leather ones we have here or they can fit completely over the ear like these microfiber ones that we have here or you can also get ones that just actually fit your ears better than what the other ones may suggest different materials and so on and so forth and you can also change the speaker units so you can get the sound signature that you want my original speaker units that I got in the original tma2 s I believe of the Esso twos and those are great for a heavy bass because I kind of like heavy bass so thats what we had on our originals now in steps the tma2 HD and the HD wireless when you order these theyre 299 for the regular HD that does not include any bluetooth youll get a all plastic headband as with the other plastic III construction but they do have really good durability they dont creak they dont pop they dont snap in any way very very durable even though theyre all plastic all the way around and thats usually one of my gripes with headbands and headphones is that I usually like to have some metal in there but these have last four years so these are definitely going to hold up to the abuse of a DJ but again when you get these in the HD version nonwireless version you have a nice Alcantara headband underneath with memory phone very soft very very comfortable for long hours of use and then when you get these and the wireless version youll get a bluetoothenabled headband that gives you three different buttons here for volume up volume down and skipping between your tracks and answering phone calls and you also have a nice rubberized style of very soft headband underneath so that way it fits on the top of your head very nicely and it doesnt really give you any type of super weight compared to the non battery and non wireless version the battery on these headbands do last for 18 hours of playback use we tested that and we did get the full 18 hours as they described and they definitely feel pretty light even when compared to the other not much of a weight difference when it goes to that but the cost difference again is 50 bucks so its up to you to decide whether you want that wireless version or the wired version when using wired or wireless version the ear cups to the actual speaker units have outlets on each side so you can always use a cable with them even if you dont want to use the wireless versions and wireless mode youll always have a backup solution with the cable that comes included with it when you get the HD Wireless you do get a nice professional cable here it really feels really good to the touch its nice and coated with this nice material to really make them feel like theyre very professional they also come with a screw on quarter inch adapter and the side that plugs into your ear cup twists and locks in place so that way it cant be yanked out very easily the III tma2 Wireless also come with two cables of course they come with a USB C charging cable and that actually fits right up inside of the headband its kind of funny to get it kind of in there just right but its nice and secure when you do get it in there and its nice and stealthy actually where they placed it so I dont mind that at all and the construction again its all plastic construction all the way around but when youre getting the HD versions youre also getting these new Alcantara ear cups and they have really nice soft plush memory foam my original III tma20 fiber and they almost look identical but the new ones are actually thicker and they actually have way better memory foam meaning when I press this down they stay kind of indented for a while you can actually see it kind of growing back out again whereas when Im using my micro fibers you dont have that same plush effect they do take a little bit of time to spring out but it comes out a lot faster than it does for these ultra comfortable Alcantara set on the Left which are the actual HD Wireless youre also getting new speaker units when you get the HD Wireless or the HD wired theyre the so8 speakers that you can find on the I website theyre nice HD sound meaning you get a good balance with the mids the lows in the highs my so2 which were bass heavy dont give you the same reproduction on the highs and on the mids but I actually like the bass more and these than I do and the Esso eighths but if you want to allaround loud and good and crisp sound then the S eights are the ones that you guys are gonna want thats what you get with the HD units again the wireless versions come in a cost of 350 you have all the aptX technology that you need in these so youre getting a very crisp signal from your source material and it sounds just as good when using these with the cable when youre not using them with a cable it always sounds about the same and we have again the regular HD wired versions these sound very good they feel very good on the head and its just up to you whether or not you want to spend that extra money in order to get the wireless configuration so in conclusion the III tma2 HD wireless and HD wired versions definitely have good construction all around they are all plastic but theyre definitely going to live up to the abuse because theyre made very very well and are definitely made to last the III tma2 is also very very customizable meaning you can change between different ear cuffs you can change between different speaker units to get the sound you definitely want and you can get the different headbands and the different cables so that way it makes it just for you exactly how you wanted them theyre also very lightweight and comfortable and the HD version gives you a nice new Wireless headband that has 18 hours of playback and the Bluetooth functionality is very very good as well and they give you them brand new so8 speakers that actually give you a nice HD style sound that are very very crisp and sounds good and all the full range of frequencies from the lows the mids and the highs on the downside at 300 to 350 Im surprised it didnt come with some type of bag or case usually at that price point you get some type of holding device so that way you can hold these and bring them with you on the go and as always with iit ma headphones they dont have any real swivel feature or any collapsible feature so that way you can have one ear on and one ear off monitoring or you can make them down into a smaller form factor for travel use so for more on the review you guys can head on over to DJ booth net  DJ s so you could type in III you can see all of our review videos right there from all of the

102248054605", "video_id": "kG5DE1xNlfg", "Closed Captions": " hello it applause and welcome back to my IT workshop so in this video Im going to do a quick review for these wireless headphones Skullcandy Reef Wireless and Ive been looking for a world lit wireless headphones for a long time now I mean Im using a regular with court headphones Im going to leave the link in the description below if youre curious they are really good but I wanted something Wireless so this one has 12 hours battery life which is really really good and if you charge them for around 10 minutes youre going to have do you have you can have them working for around 2 hours so thats pretty cool in my opinion so Im going to use these more for my desktop computer not not much for my cell phone or all that because I like to use it I spend a lot of a lot of time off my desktop so here we are we open the box and now were going to open this little box so you can see here this one is charged using a micro USB I I wish these were USBC but thats not the case but thats not bit of a deal then we have the 2 year global warranty thats pretty cool now were going to check the instructions which Im going to show you later you can see there and now were going to check the actual headphones so as you can see here this color is grey and green there are many colors of course this is not the only one but this is the one I chose for this one now this has it has this plastic cover you can like any other headphones you can adjust the size for your head so thats thats kind of well thats standard lets say now Im going to take out these plastic covers and Im going to show you how it looks these headphones also have a microphone builtin so thats really good too I dont use much the microphone to be honest because I already have a good microphone but thats a bird for example when you are on a cell phone if youre going to use it for a cell phone or for a tablet its really good to have and you can fold it like Im doing in the video if you are going to go for a walk if you have to go to school or to university or something like that out of real going for a walk Im real light but I also what I like a lot is that there is super comfortable on the ears so thats really good this is one I use actually the blue ones with orange and Ive been using these for about one month and I dont have any complain about this its really good I bought the the silver one for my office so I dont have to take them to work and then I might forget it I come back a I forgot my headphones so thats why I have these two so again its very comfortable on the ear on the years this very very breeze of material and thats something that for me is very very important now what we are going to do next is Im going to Im going to still show you around how they look they have many other colors like like I mentioned a few a few seconds ago and now since this is going to be for my desktop I dont have Bluetooth builtin in my desktop computer thats why I bought these Wireless well this USB bluetooth adapter I believe it cost like six dollar five dollars and going to lean Im going to leave the link to Amazon in the video description as well so its really quick you just connect it and after a few seconds you have a Bluetooth thats not big of a deal if you are doing this on a laptop or cell phone you dont need these of course so these are the instruction very straightforward if you press it for five seconds its going to turn on its going to blink the lights going to blink to pair and then you have these other options like the track back track forward the volume if you press it once its going to answer a call and if you want to activate voice assist and in my case would be Cortana you have to press fast two times so thats pretty cool if you are on a cell phone whether its Android or Apple is going to trigger the voice at the virtual assistant as well so its very straightforward to follow is really easy to use I like it a lot because of that way that thats one of one of the reason I like a lot of now Im going to show you Im going to keep it the phrase for about five seconds and as you can see its on now so its in pair mode so its blinking like in like it says in the extra instructions so it has only three buttons the one in the center and the volume up and volume down so as you can see here Im testing it and what were going to do now since Im in Windows Im going to connect it to this computer so here we are as you can see the icons are a little bigger so you can see it better so Im going to type settings and Im going to choose that option and then were going to go to devices we click on it and the Bluetooth since its already connected the USB Bluetooth adapter I dont have to do anything else its you dont have to sell it or anything its automatic and then I go to add Bluetooth devices so Bluetooth and its going to look for the headphones there you go breathe wireless so Im going to take a few seconds to pair it and thats it that was really fast the videos not to speed up or anything that was quick so as you can see I have two the one I just bought which is the silver and the other which is this the blue and orange so I dont have anything else to do here so were going to go back to the headphones itself well themselves so as you can see here its blinking and now its blinking blue so that means its pair and that the device is its on it tells you on the headphones you can youre going to listen something like pair or something like that so you know its better so now we are going to to see the instructions I dont know not instruction Im sorry were going to listen to some music so you can see how how it sounds alright so allow me a few seconds while Im trying to do that so here we go Music Applause Music so there you go that was that was playing some classical music the maximum volume thats how it sound so when you go to David to the limit is going to blink even its not going to its going to make like a bit telling you hey this is the max volume and when you go down its going to make another beep saying hey this is the low as we can go so it has good sound you have heard that is good I believes good volume is poor its never a good idea to have the highest volume because youre going to damage your ears now another thing one drawback which I would say if youre going to choose these to make cardio for example is not advisable I try it and it makes your ears a little hot and youre going to be sweaty and all that its not advisable to that its for walking maybe or to stay at home well now when Im at home I I just put it on my neck and I walk around if Im listening to music or something like that it has a really good range I would say that thats another thing like a lot for the charge that I think its very very short I already had this long charger about 1 meters or what how much how many mean like 3 feet something like that when the battery is is low I just connected and I can still use it so but but thats Im not saying that super inconvenience Im just telling you I already had the cable so thats what I wanted to show you this video oh by the way this video is not sponsored or anything I just look for I just need it I just want it to change really my headphones too for wireless ones and I wanted to buy something that is really comfortable good quality but its not super expensive like I dont know 300 or 100 or something like that so thats why Ive made the city so thank you very own you the microphone there I maybe I forgot to show it before but thats what I wanted to show you this video guys so Im going to leave the link in the description below if you liked this video please leave a like and subscribe if you have any other

Captions": " hi guys Kevin here so today were gonna review this baby right here which is Sonys premium sports true well is it but in for you to go outdoor and explore your world and true all the funny adventures that you may face together with your friends or if you are a loner like me because it has ip68 meaning its dust and water resistance when it comes to the water resistant it means you can swim in salt water for a long duration or even chlorinated poor water if you are a little bit of that coward kind of person but again different people have different poisons so yeah this baby right here is powered by a pair of bellows amateur drivers so expect battery long battery life as well as bluetooth 40 for corn activities a little bit older than blue 250 but both of them differ my new lee now to power on and power of the earbuds is only one way which is taking off the case and putting back into the case i wish at this price point since it has the button right here a long press on the button would actually power on or power off since it has internal storage which well cover in a later bit the good news is on this true while its a bus right here you can control the volume easily without the need to access your well smartphone the left side is lowering the volume the right side right here is to increase the volume so okay now this babys right here do not have active noise cancellation but when it comes to the peso sound isolation meaning the physical highway alone its amazing because it goes deep into the ear canal and blocking a lot more of the environmental noises i feel it blocks more than its more premium brother which is the true wireless 1000x mark tree which i cover in the previous review and one thing about this ear tips is because its designed for swimming you can adjust the ear tips whether you want to push it inwards or outwards so it can even block the environmental noise more or even prevent the liquid going into your ears so something to note right there this true wireless device right here features a four gig onboard memory where you can store up to 900 songs without being connected to the smartphone this means it helps with battery life longer battery life obviously and you can not bring your smartphone to get destructor just focus on your running your sports and your other lifestyle activities instead the rate of battery life is three hours when the pair is used together the charging case gives additional chav hours hour battery life test is based on the Samsung S 10 e at the fourth volume bar we managed to get a total of 13 hours and 45 minutes now for audio quality test for Papa Indian I choose can be okay low base frequency is superbly energetic and superbly notable you can feel the air pressure movement in your ears significantly lower base does overpower the vocals in terms of audible level but not much vocal surprisingly sounds sharp and not muffled sound for PR me I do again the bass is highly energetic in highly notable the base fits to first and a two minute and five seconds of the song the vibrations is little or barely noticeable the bass does not overpower the vocals it feels like balance a little bit right here EDM tone sounds alive and highly energetic for vocals and instrumentals I choose violin the raindrop the piano and a varying tone is the warm sounding type and not the crystal killer type I prefer the crystal type alone it needs more shine at the highest the drum does overpower the piano and violin significantly that is not how the song is intended to be when it comes to patter Tony see true when it comes to Mitch grasses highpitched male channel because it performed decently at a height great amount of shine is needed at the highest every diction and pronunciation it feels a little bit soft and maybe a little bit muted right here what could be boxing echoing and humming is great but thats overpower Mitch Garcias vocal in a song and the main vocals basically lose focus right here so heres my take on this true wireless air bus right here this one is more on the bass heavy it performs well from the lows to the upper mids where its core strength is more on the EDM pop and BC type of songs so if youre a refined person you may want to jump on the sony true Wireless which is the 1000 X mark tree that is more for the refined people who is listening to vocals acapella and instrumentals this one is for the energetic fight right here it has the four gig onboard memory right here where you can store song so you can listen without the need of smartphone well you cannot bring a smartphone in a swimming pool or saltwater if not youre going this appear so it works as intended to be when I recommend this as a sports earbuds right here at this price is a bit hard to swallow but if youre looking for this necessary features definitely this would be a first priority right here for running I would say but for those dreamers I would say yeah thanks for watching this

so I picked up the Sony WH XP 700 this is from their extra base headphone lineup so in this video what Im gonna do is Im gonna review these headsets and Im gonna show you how it looks like how it works and then Im gonna tell you how these sound quality is like alright so this is the box in which the headset comes out so a quick look at the back this is how the headphone looks like by the way and weve got handsfree calling with the HD voice obviously its called a microphone on board ten minutes of charge playback up to 90 minutes and then 30 hours of continuous music playback voice assist compatible with Google app and Siri and it charges through USB typec and its what I headphone cable why because this thing can be operated passively so in case you run out of charge you can use these passively by plugging in a headphone cable but yeah you cant really do that on your phones because yeah no more headphone jack so this is one of the reasons why I am upgrading to this anyways thats it get out of the box by the way this one is also compatible with Google assistant and its got alexa built in and yes this only bluetooth headset will work with iPhone iPod Android Windows PC or a Mac and provided Windows PC has bluetooth onboard anyways let me get the headset out of the box and we will see what all stuff is supplied inside the box right so here Rd do to protect I look nice this is the blue color so this is what you get inside the box first off we have a USB typec charging cable the threeandahalf millimeter headphone cable to operate this passively and then we have the Quick Start Guide and the user manual also inside the box it shows you that you should download the Sony headphone connect app and you dont really need this this is not mandatory by the way but still go ahead and download this app on your phone so now let us take a look at the headset itself by the way you get this in two colors blue and black I picked up the blue color also do keep in mind the XP 700 does not have active digital noise cancellation so whatever noise is going to be blocked as the cause of this foam pad around the earpiece cup and I have already done some testing at the Sony store the noise cancellation is quite ok its not as good as active digital noise cancellation but its fairly decent considering you dont have active noise cancellation also the design is slightly different by the way these speakers or like this you can keep it on the table Sonys design language has also changed a little bit compared to the older headsets so this is the sony MDR XP 450 so this was their previous design language quite flashy and this is the newer design language not that flashy and kind of looks more professional compared to the old one but to be honest if you asked me I do like the order design language I like this metal thingy effect but this is plastic indeed just like this one enjoying the content well make sure to subscribe and do press that Bell icon so that you can get notifications to my latest uploads lets continue so coming back to our XP 700 you can see these speakers are clearly labeled left and right then the pan which goes around the head this one is nice and soft so this one is padded and I think this is leather its nice and soft and if I then these you can see this is metal and it does become quite big so even if you have a big head this one will fit without any problem and because of the metal band the build quality of the headset is quite good although it does feel a little plasticky because of this plastic but I dont really think this will break easily especially when you have a metal metal band that goes around like this overall I do like the build quality feels nice and solid and weve got the Sony branding over here got Sony branding on either side itll look at the buttons so this is your USB typec charging port the headphone jack connector so you can use these passively the microphone and weve got the power button the custom button to activate Alexa or Google assistant then we have the volume buttons plus n minus a pause and forward button is over here forward or rewind and this is on the right side so the right side has the volume buttons and the power button is only left also xb 700 has NFC so the NFC is over here for easy pairing now pairing the xB 700 is super duper easy all you have to do is turn the headset on wait for the led to blink so right now it is in pairing mode and all you have to do is grab your phone make sure NFC is turned on and just have the back of your phone onto the headphone like this and it says parity Bluetooth device yes and this LED should stop blinking like this okay and that is it the headset is now paired with the Samsung Galaxy Note 1000 if you want to pair the headset with another smartphone well if your smartphone has NFC you can just have the back of the phone to the headset and it will pair automatically otherwise if you want to do manual pairing of any headset is turned on press and hold the power button for about seven seconds and you will see this LED will start blinking now the headset is in pairing mode so to do manual pairing turn on bluetooth go to Bluetooth settings so available devices pairing okay and that is it it has now paired with another smartphone but I do recommend that you used NFC because it is a lot easier to pair and unpair using NFC its just one tap it will get disconnected see now its disconnected one tap it will get connected automatically see that it is now connected so now let me show you the functionality of all these buttons which are on your headset so first off you can see this is the right side and this is the left so you will be pushing your headphones on like this so that means the volume control buttons will be on your right so these are your volume controls plus and minus and the middle one is prayer pause so press at once the music starts playing then this is to decrease the volume and just first increase the volume now if you double press the middle button this will switch over to the next song again double press switches to the next song now if you press this three times it goes back to the previous song again three times it goes back to the previous song press it once it stops playing pauses the music press it once again it starts playing these are all your music controls over here by the way this one also answers the call so now if we give myself a phone call so you guys can see I am getting a phone call to answer the call I just have to press this button once and that answers the call to end the call press this once and they call the end you can see the call has ended the music playback resumes so thats how these buttons function now moving on to the left side this is the button this custom button s for google assistant so let me quickly demonstrate the google assistant functionality so cup my xiaomi bedside table lamp here this one is connected to WiFi so press and hold the custom button to give google assistant commands turn on bedside lamp check that out that is awesome now if you press this once and release the google assistant will read out your time and it will tell you if you have any notifications so in case you have any notifications the Google assistance would actually read that out for you this is your power button press and hold to turn the power off see that turns the power off if I want to turn the headphones on press and hold the upper kurds on so it is SuperDuper easy to operate this you can see it has automatically connected to the phone if you press the power button once it will tell you the battery level of the headset Im gonna do that again near the camera battery only charged and then over here we have the USB typec and the headphone jack now in case your battery runs out or if you want to use these passively with a wire you can also do that so you have a three and a half millimeter headphone jack over here so right now the headset is turned on the LED is blinking as soon as I plug in the wire this kills the Bluetooth functionality so the headset will get disconnected Bluetooth turns off and now I can use these passively like a normal headset so thats it all you need to do is connect and hear song and it will work no problem you can hear the sound it may be music coming Applause so this is the passive functionality of these headphones I think this is quite a nice touch in case your battery runs out you can just plug in your cable and still enjoy the music so let me give you guys a quick demo of how these headsets unlike especially the clear piece although I dont really think this sound recorder will be able to capture the full depth in the quality of these headphones so anyways well give this a try right now the level is low Applause so I hope that gives you guys an idea on how these headphones sound light if bass is awesome I dont think this recorder will be able to capture the full depth of the sound but these headphones do sound quite nice so now let me show you how they look like when you are wearing them okay so this is how the headset looks like when you wear them now they do look a little big and heavy at first glance but they really are not that big or heavy these are medium sized headsets although they are definitely heavier than your regular non bluetooth headset but hey they do feel quite comfortable to wear I bought them for an hour and a half during my commute and no they did not cause any discomfort and the nice thick foam around the earpiece cup does block pmf noise and I also like to wear my hat when Im outside so these headphones are big enough to accommodate that no problems now coming to the sound quality I would say that the sound quality of the whx b700 is great for the price when I was testing these I did not use any equalizer and the clear base was set to level 5 that seems to be the sweet spot with these headset and with this sort of a setting the headset retains mids and highs even at higher volumes and there is a good level of bass although I do recommend keeping the volume below 50 if you value your ears as these do tend to get quite loud also there is no distortion skipping or lacks speaking of skipping the range is also quite good I have not experienced any disconnection issues I can roam about in my room without having any connection issues on this headset so concluding thoughts I would say that the xB 700 is a great wireless stereo Bluetooth headset it gives you a good balance between price and some quality with great battery backup although I do recommend that you go to Sony Center and try it out yourself before purchasing them because everyone has different preferences and hey if you like a lot of bass then turn off that clear based setting and enjoy your music with a ton of punchy bass and lastly if I have to pick one thing that I dont like about this headset well that is the plastic and it makes the headset feels less expensive than including yes Sony has done a better job on their older design especially the one on the MDR XD 450 but hey its a personal choice I personally seem to prefer the old design compared to the new one and check this out my razor playstation chroma also doubles up as a charging stand for my new sony wireless headphones pretty darn awesome right alright so I guess that pretty much wraps it up for this video if you guys have any questions about the xB 700 and let me know in the comments below and Ill try and reply to you guys and by the way I recharge the battery on Friday I guess Friday afternoon and right now it is Sunday morning Sunday early morning it is 256 am yeah so it is Sunday and my battery level is still 100 so this headphone does have a pretty darn good battery backup 30 hours of continuous playback and I have been listening to songs quite affect I guess two hours yesterday and two hours today so yeah battery backup on this headset is quite good anyway guys thank you for watching this stay tuned for more videos and I will see you guys next time", "video_title": "Sony Extra Bass WHXB700 Bluetooth Wireless Headphones Review",

gaming hardware companies try to make headphones more often than not it doesnt go right but today were going to check out the ROG Strix GO 24 Wireless Gaming headphone from Asus and it really offers some features that I have not seen before along with some really good decisions about the design and functionality of the headphone Hey guys I am Siddharth and in this big picture of excellence there is one issue that keeps it from being the right choice for everyone and were going to talk about that Opening the box you get greeted by this welcome card which shines in multiple colors then we get to some manuals and then we get to this nice and hard carrying case which feels very high quality It also comes with a pocket on back which can be handy Inside we get this braided 35mm cable because you can also use this in wired mode Then we get a USB cable for charging the detachable microphone a USB A to USB C adapter you get the receiver for the headphone which we will talk about later and finally we get to the headphones I have the electro punk version of these headphones so it has these pink accents and translucent plastic But the regular version comes in the usual black colour The ROG Strix GO has won an IF design award and it is easy to see why This is one of the most well thought out designs that I have seen in a wireless headphone Every part of this headphones design is just so good that you wouldnt think this wasnt made by a proper headphone brand The headband cushion is really nice the earcups swivel to 90 degrees so you can rest them on your chest while not using them the earpads are very soft and they have a really amazing shape with these long earcups that are very comfortable while still being compact because the human ear is shaped like that You really have to look closely to realize what a level of attention to detail is on this headphone the clicky metal headband adjustment has ROG logo printed on it and even the earcups have rubber pads in the places they make contact with the headband The subtle ROG logos on the earcups also integrate well with the aesthetics without overdoing it Next to the power switch on the headphone you have a multifunction button which you can use to play pause and change tracks and then you have the volume rocker and you have to hold it up or down to increase or decrease volume and if you press it inside it will mute the mic A dedicated button to mute the mic would have been better but this system also works fine The comfort is good with the nicely shaped earpads that also have very nice memory foam but it can get a little hot because of how airtight of a seal it forms around your ears A character that I frequently observe in headphones with pleather pads and memory foam The earpads on these also dont seem removable and I am not going to make a big deal out of this because most gaming headsets dont have removable earpads but every premium headphone should have removable earpads whether it is meant for gaming or not As the name suggests the Strix Go 24 works with a 24 GHz wireless connection and it comes with this USB Type C dongle that you will have to connect with whatever you want to use this with The advantage of this is that unlike something with a Bluetooth connection you wont be facing any latency issues which is critical for gaming and because it has a USB type C port you can use this with your PC laptop Nintendo switch your phones and even with iPhones and iPads if you are okay with living a dongle life People have been asking me for a wireless headset to use for PUBG Mobile for a long time so this will be really good You can of course use it in a wired mode by plugging the cable in and this headphone also comes in a wired version The microphones on this are a very big highlight and I say microphones because there are actually 2 of them So you do have a detachable boom mic which is easily adjustable but you may often forget to have it plugged in or you might be using this with your phone without having it plugged so for that Asus has included an in built microphone which is a really amazing idea and this is how the inbuilt microphone on the headphone sounds like and it sounds pretty good for an inbuilt microphone But the boom mic on these headphones is very extraordinary because it includes Asus AI Noise cancellation and when I first heard about it I just thought it was a gimmick because brands just keep adding AI to everything they release but I was really blown away by how well it works when I tried it So this is what the boom microphone sounds like and you can hear that it sounds pretty decent but now I will play music on my phone at full volume and you can hear with the lav mic how loud the phone is But now I have switched to the mic on the ROG Strix Go and I think you must be able to hear how well it is rejecting the noise from such a loud source thats close to it The inbuilt mic doesnt reject sound as well as this because it has to pick up your voice from a distance So for regular kinds of noises that you have around this should work extremely well and suppose youre in a gaming cafe where many people are shouting this should be able to reject that noise well which is kind of a big deal By the way make sure that youre subscribed to the channel with bell icon so you dont miss out on future videos The battery life on these is around 25 hours and they also work if you keep them plugged in with a charger while using them and they also support fast charging with 15 minutes of charge providing 3 hours so you really should not face any issues with the battery life Coming to sound quality I think this is a very capable gaming headset The soundstage and imaging on these is nicer than the lower priced gaming headsets that I have tried and you do feel a very good sense of movement when things go from left to right or when there is action going on on a distance in a game But these have a very treble emphasized sound signature and its almost like they just pushed the treble frequencies up by 4 or 5 decibels So for music and general non gaming use I really didnt like these at all If you listen to electronic music that is treble heavy on these then your ears will probably start hurting They do have high quality drivers so even with the emphasized treble you dont feel a sense of piercing sound on your eardrums but the boost in treble is so high that you do feel the pressure of the higher frequencies on your eardrums and it is not a comfortable feeling You can tone it down by using similar equalizer settings like these and you can see that I have to reduce the treble by 4 or 6 decibels and then it manages to sound decent for music but even then I wasnt able to make it sound right One quality I noticed is that even though the treble is boosted the gunshots sound tolerable but if you are playing something that has a lot going on in the high end then you could find it to be fatiguing If you are a bass head then these will definitely not be for you Even for people who like balanced bass I think these do lack them by a decibel or two This is also an issue that I wasnt able to correct with equalizer So while I think that these should be good for gaming especially for people who like a treble heavy sound signature because it helps them in hearing the footsteps more easily I dont think that they will be great for general media consumption I also asked this question in audiophile groups that I am a member of and most people did share similar thoughts as me on this subject of what kind of sound signature is better for gaming But I also had very vocal responses from some people who said that they like treble emphasized headphones for gaming and some said that they find high treble headphones to provide better clarity in footsteps and voices so you will have to know what you want and you could also let me know in the comments section about what kind of sound signature you like for gaming In conclusion I have slightly mixed feelings about this headphone I totally love how well made it is the attention to details that it has I like how it looks the microphone works extremely well and the second internal microphone is just a genius idea Battery life is great comfort is great and it is just a headphone that has been executed very well These cost around 200 US Dollars and I think these do have enough technology and quality to justify the price The sound is something that I do not agree on as a person who mostly reviews audiophile gear I have gamer friends who also share similar thoughts about how gaming headphones should sound like but there are people who do like this high treble sound signature and for those people these are really going to be the best gaming headphones in this range But if you like a balanced sound in a headphone or if you want to enjoy the strong bass lines in music or in movies then these are not going to be the ones for you these are strictly meant to be used as gaming headsets only Generally I dont care a lot about a product if it has a character that I dont like but this particular headphone just does everything else so well that I do feel a little sad that the sound signature is not more versatile Non removable earpads at this price ping are also not a good thing So Ill have links to buy this in the video description

Captions": " Music Applause Music Applause hi this is Brian Campbell with old man new tech its where we review budget electronics from a generation extras perspective why do we do it how we do it to save you money but we cant do this channel without you so if you could hit subscribe down below and smash that little bell and youll get notified every time a new video comes out youll also get your weekly dose of back in the day okay so here at old man new tech Im always on the prowl for some decent active noisecancelling headphones youll notice on my channel and Ill put some links to some previous videos up above Ive done some reviews I found some really good ones like the taotronics bh0 six zeros the TEL atronics bh 0 4 7s and the company Cohen saw these videos and they wanted to throw their their their hat in the ring and they sent me the Cowen se7 is now full disclosure they did send me these to review but as always Ill give you my honest opinion about them and see if they stack up to the Sonys and the Bose headphones of the world so I did a little research and I found these on Amazon and they come highly recommended by Amazon which means that theyve gotten a lot of reviews and theyve also gotten a lot of high ratings so you can find them for about 87 now Colin claims that there is super comfort and foldable low latency unsurpassed sound and up to 50 hours of play time so lets see if Colin delivers on the promises remember I did a review of cowan earbuds a few months back and I really liked him I highly recommended him so I had a good experience so my expectations are pretty high for these sexy little beasts right here so onto the unboxing first of all the the box itself is pretty plain flat black not gonna show any prints nice silver embossing theres your Cowan su7 a and C wireless headphones and a little bit of info on the social deteriorate forward boxing lets see what they look like on the inside no nice so we have our our Cowan VIP card which weve already seen before thatll get you into all of the all of this secret parties at Cowan host Im just kidding there but you will get additional extended warranties youll be first in line for new products and exclusive discounts and they do have good customer support at Cowan so I do recommend going online and registering your product weve got our instruction manual there we go our user guide for the se7en c wireless headphones now these are pretty straightforward so not gonna worry about these right now alright the first thing I notice is the case it is a fine rich cutting theanine editor for your kids out there that was my best for card old Montalban by the way I love it when a case is included take note electronic companies thats the way to do it include a case with your headphones now inside the case okay so first thing I notice is the accessory case nice classy velvet accessory case were gonna find out various connectors weve got a micro USB down there 35 millimeter doubleended aux cable so if you do run out pop run out of power you can plug this into your music source and you can wear it directly but thats not why I got these headphones I like bluetooth weve got an adapter for airplanes last but not least weve got a quarterinch jack adapter for higherend audio equipment so cool accessories nice little carrying bag there lets take a look at the headphones themselves so first impressions visually the cowan se7en C headphones have a clean minimalist look so they have nice black matte finish and you can get them in other colors I prefer the classy black theres a cute little embossment there that gives a little shine on the headphones but theyre pretty low profile and not sure if you can eat it but they do have whats called protein padding for the ear cups now this protein padding is about as close as you can get to memory foam and theyre very comfortable I got to tell you Ive had these on a couple headphones now and theyre really comfortable the headband is flexible and Music the ear cups rotate 180 degrees so they fit easily around your neck and fit really nice to your whatever shape skull you got there you know its aluminum here for the interior of the headband thats adjustable so you can adjust the size depending on the size of your head youre going to notice that same protein padding here along the top of the headband that makes it comfortable to wear on top of your head and really the comfort level on these on a scale of one to ten I give them about a nine they are very comfortable its kind of hard to read here but they are labeled right and left on the inside of the headband so youll know which ear to put them on and notice the separate noise canceling switch right here so you turn that on if you like it shines green when its on its important to note because this switch operates independently of the power switch what that means is that it could be left on accidentally and if it is you could go too long itll wear out the battery here we have the upanddown volume control this is your power and your Bluetooth button it also answers phone calls heres your port for your 35 millimeter jack and its still using a micro SB minor quibble with a lot of these companies I cant wait for a lot of you guys to migrate to us BC because I hate having to figure out which way to turn the charging cable when Im plugging this in frustrating for you let me know down below Music now the battery life claims to be 50 hours and Im sorry to say that I did not test it for a complete 50 hours I will tell you that I have worn them for an entire week not charge them one time use them once or twice a day never ran out of power and they do charge relatively quickly within I would say an hour an hour and a half youll have a complete charge on these even though I never ran a ran them out they do last for quite a while so thats it for the looks lets see how they sound and listen to music you get really good midrange but its their very basic theyre one of the bass ear headphones that Ive reviewed so far Im gonna give you a little bit of a listen to them here with my microphone so hopefully can hear that and I gotta tell you the bass on that is incredible the mid ranges are really smooth with no Distortion the upper end also when you crank them up youre not getting a lot of the source in there you could hurt your ears if you crank them up a little bit loud so once on the cowan se 7s are really comfortable and theyre a little they grab a little bit tighter than the top tronic had set that I have upstairs but they really stay on good theyre very comfortable and I got to tell you a worn them for hours with no discomfort and and quite cool they dont they dont get as hot as some other headphones that Ive used before including the tail Tronics so and I think thats because the protein padding is a little bit more firm and it it holds itself a little bit farther away from the the head and the scalp so they theyre very comfortable and like I said they stay on fairly firm and tighter to the head they dont project out as much as a lot of other headsets do and just on with the active noise canceling on you do get silenced Im not hearing that that white hiss or the white noise and thats a matter of preference some people they do like white noise when they hear active noisecancelling it helps them relax but this is performing on the level of what Ive heard with Sony and Bose headsets final impressions so for final impressions you know I got to say that that these are really nice headphones and they look like theyre going to last for a very long time so theyre a high quality headset the noise is really good noise noise cancelling is really good and it does a great job of blocking out a lot of the low frequency noises that can drive you nuts whether it be on an airplane or in the house if youre doing laundry something like that they sound good  is that the music quality was great on them the latency was almost nonexistent bluetooth 50 really steps up the range and the battery life on them is stellar so I would have to say that I highly highly recommend the kawan se sevens a and now back in the day so the year was 1976 the Bicentennial and the movie star wars had been released to the theatres Star Wars a new hope episode four yours truly old man Brian Campbell was a Star Wars fanatic I saw it 11 times at the very least 11 times at the movie theater and back in the day what we did to entertain ourselves in between the sequels was weve collected Star Wars cards they came with bubble gum sometimes you would get doubles but you have to collect your favorite hero they even came with stickers which I have not peeled off yet they came out in different colors as they were released in between the sequels heres my Ben Kenobi Luke Skywalker and c3po but we will collect and trade these cards Im not sure if theyre worth anything now but to us they were priceless back in the day hey

content please give it a thumbs up subscribe turn your notifications on I am here to unbox and save you money all of the deals that Im gonna showcase are available on Matts daily dealscom or reminder I do use affiliate links so if you are kind enough to use one of my links I will benefit monetarily but more importantly lets get to the unboxing so Im going to go through the deals as the least expensive and then the most expensive on the spectrum theres a pair of headphones that you dont see for example theres brands I love like Sennheiser theyre just not on sale right now at the time Im recording this video so these are the best headphone deals on sales so lets start at the lowest and in terms of price although that by no means refers to low performance up got a pop up by the way feel free to join my email list the pair of headphones that I want to begin with is a good pair of over the ear headphones down to 3999 from a hundred now with these headphones which are actually engineered in Las Vegas at the Consumer Electronics Show this is a pair of headphones where I get the breathability its comfortable in fact let me let me show these to you up close the decibel bluetooth headphones especially the club studio headphones have an enhanced sound quality so your music will sound great you can quickly interrupt phone calls because this will allow for call answering with a builtin microphone you get the upgraded new bluetooth technology so at least 33 feet range and well most headphones on the market give you six to eight hours this promises a minimum of 10 and Ive tested them at 11 and 11 and a half hours super breathable 39 bucks down from 100 best headphone deal number one now thats good for studying thats good for everyone being all home at the same time and if your classes arent resuming anytime soon are youre doing that virtual learning this pair of headphones would be ideal for that I know someone that studies with classical music through these I would a hundred percent listen to death metal I also love Marilyn Manson thank you for listening lets move on to the second deal and I want to remind anyone watching right now the air pods are completely overpriced in fact for the price of the air pause in this little dental floss case that you get I would invest in this pair of JBL headphones now should mention the price that you see on your screen right now is reduced but youll probably get a better deal if you wait a week or two oh no its here here it is my bad 69 bucks sorry this price change it really depends on the color you pick I knew you could get a better price thats why Im here the prices are changing every three seconds and a reminder on Matts daily dealscom I do have the uptodate pricing but 69 bucks damn from 99 the playback on here is virtually identical to what you would get out of the air plots I like the fact that the case is a little bit bigger Im a klutz Im less likely to lose this just that little bit of size I actually think makes a bit of a difference they feel weighted when Ive had these in my ears and the battery performance is almost identical all of the manufacturers will over claim when it comes to battery life the air pods you get four or five if youre lucky sometimes only three or four after youve used them for a long period of time the JBLs claimed four hours of playback twelve hours out of the charging case I got about three and a half when I did this and for these which claimed 10 hours the reason I keep going back to these is because I actually got more than 10 hours on a couple of occasions so that was a nice thing deal number two deal number three Ive never been a huge fan of beats by dre I always feel as though youre paying for a brand name or an aesthetic its not worth full price ever in my opinion but these are sweat resistant and these are a huge price drop right now eighty nine ninety five down from two hundred year saving 110 bucks I like the splash of color and the headphones although you have to keep in mind that these are not truly wireless earphones well talk about that so these are sweat and water resistant theyre good for the gym if you guys look at me you know Ive really never worked out a day in my life and thats just fine trying to work on that but Im not getting anywhere in these headphones because they have the hook they stay in differently when theyre on your ears and I always prefer these generally if I am on the go to something that just fits inside your ear with that being said a pair of truly wireless earphones dont have a great battery life because theyre both using their own independent Bluetooth connections to communicate with what could be a tablet a smartphone a desktop a laptop and well its great that you can use one at a time which is a good way if you just have calls coming in or when Im reporting on national television Ill put one of these in and just hear the anchors through one year which is which is great I dont need to use to the downside is you get less of a battery life on these power beats youre going to get twelve hours instead of your typical five for the price which is great because they are sharing some power capabilities through the wire that adjoins them on the back of your neck you dont mind that wire its a great bang for your buck and that will bring me now to another deal headphone deal number three as we climb up on the headphone spectrum lets talk about the Bose sound sport true wireless earbuds so these are both truly wireless the battery performance out of here is good youre gonna get around five hours and this is good for people are on the go this is sweat and waterresistant a couple of features that I like for these wireless headphones they have that little ear mechanism where they balance a little bit better when theyre inside your ear Ill show you a trick though for the Apple earpods you know in a moment if you really want that and you you desperately need Apple earpods but these are grateful running around from moving around sweat and waterresistant and they have some great features where you can actually track your earbuds with the case you get 10 hours out of this case it is a larger case may be a bit more cumbersome for a pocket but it fits well and you can also reverse track your headphones which is a beautiful thing if youve lost your earbuds as I do all the time you can actually track them on a map which is a great feature tied to the Bose products I love the sound on this I like the size of the case and if you love these headphones this would be my top pick number four is one of the top deals of the season although keep in mind if you do have 149 dollars to spend and you are a galaxy user a Samsung product affection Auto as I am for an on sale price the list price of 149 dollars at the time I am uploading for the Samsung Galaxy buds plus is a great grab now theres different colors for this I love the Samsung Galaxy buds these headphones have some incredible audio engineering and some good active noise cancellation so with these get 22 hours of battery life and my tests just shy of that 11 out of the headphones and then when you charge them in the case you get another 11 hours so be careful when you see 22 it refers to two different things it connects well with both Apple and Android devices the onestep connect obviously if youre an Android user is great and youre going to find that the ambience awesome so if you want to hear a little bit of the background noise in my house if I am streaming or Im trying to record a podcast or I want to keep an ear on my daughter who is napping in her crib I control that with the ambience where and I can determine just how much of the surrounding noise comes into my headphones the fast charging time on here is great it is a three minute charge time to give you one hours of performance which is amazing beats has a similar feature which well discuss which is called fast fuel on one of their higherend headphones but the sound engineering on here you got a tweeter and woofer on the headphones for AKG engineering at its best so just throwing that out there the Bose is one of the best deals of the season but if you had the same amount of money to spend the regular list price on the Samsung Galaxy buds might make that a better contender if the active noise cancellation is important for you it is better on this pair of headphones deal number five is a bit of a tie if I had to switch between two different headphones that fulfill two different types of purposes so the power beats pro at 199 down from 249 would actually make this one of the best beat deals of the season never in my life that I think I would have two beats products on a top five list as you can tell Im not a huge fan of Beats but this is a very well engineered pair of headphones I will tell you that theyre totally wireless they are high performance earphones youre gonna get a battery life of around eight and a half hours out of here although they do claim nine Ive achieved that only twice in my tests they are great because you have the independent controls on each ear but and if you move around a lot be stay in for a little bit less money than the Apple earpods Pro youre going to find the battery life on this much better the charging case better and I actually prefer the design this is a good pair of headphones for someone that is athletic for someone that moves around and if youre watching now and you do a lot of multitasking as I do you got the laundry basket in one hand youre working from home youre trying to empty the dishwasher youve got a baby theyve got all these things going on they are great because they do stay in but I do have a runnerup deal and another deal and a way to actually improve your Apple earpods which well talk about in a moment the Bose QuietComfort headphones at 289 down from three 49 are a great deal I didnt include this in my top five because they only offered this discount frequently on the rose gold though they have Alexa built in and so many other great features tied to this if you are not looking for rose gold headphones it would be difficult for me to actually include this on the list because the other colors are very infrequently reduced with that being said you get superb active noise cancellation and that on beyond a wear feature that I showed you on the Samsung Galaxy buds plus its also present with the app that you can use on these headphones and I think theyve got a graphic of the app there we go so that one out gives you the complete control that you would want over your headphones this may be complete overkill my thought on that is for a pair of headphones that gives you a similar feel to the Bose doesnt obviously have that level of active noise cancellation and it doesnt have an app but this is 3999 and for 200 more on sale is it worth getting that active noise cancellation these days I dont find myself in the loud environments that I used to be in our crowds how we gather everything has kind of changed a little bit Im not trying to drown out jet engines every three days as I commute between Toronto and New York so for me I think that active noise cancellation is an overkill but Im just throwing that in there and now lets move on to the bonus deal and then that quick trick for your air pods the bonus deals are pair headphones I just finished testing its not on sale which is why Im not including it as a top deal of the season but it is a great design and a good list price and youll find that although they have a 10 on a couple of items these do reduce from time to time I just think this is an ingenious design the superior sound on here is very similar to the JBLs that I showed you the difference is that JBLs are not waterproof they are not sweat proof and theres 69 bucks theyre a brand name and theyve got great audio but on these truly wireless headphones I found the audio may be a little bit less perhaps slightly less bass but you do get the ipx7 waterproofing level and how smart is this you have a charge indicator on your case so on the Apple air pots if I want to know how much time is left on my air pods I have to put them in my air I have to wait for it to come up on the phone a lot of the time it doesnt actually even give me the information thats accurate this is on the case which beautiful thing and then the case on here also acts as a power bank so itll charge your smartphone that is an amazing 45 and 099 deal or maybe less depending on when youre watching it and these headphones do use bluetooth 51 which makes it a great grab and a wonderful wellbalanced product now I cant actually give you a conclusive battery life number for this Ive ordered a new pair I think I had a predecessor which doesnt have the exact same design so I cant make any claims in terms of battery life performance but you can read the reviews in the ratings people are very happy with these and now if you have the Apple earpods of the air pod Pro and you want to improve them or if you absolutely need to get these because theyre so trending so hip just like I am let me show you this I will tell you the Apple earpods with the charging case are twenty nine dollars off the air pod pros are fourteen dollars and these discounts seem to continue to exist week after week so if theyre not on sale on one particular week they will be on sale another and if you head over to mass daily dealscom get on my email newsletter I will update you on prices as they happen but the big takeaway is if your air pods are not staying in your ear nicely or if you have a pair of air pod knockoffs or alternates which Ive actually covered in a different video get the ear hooks you can get three pairs of ear hooks for around eleven ninety five theyre incredibly well rated and these will ensure you never need to adjust your ear pods ever again when I wear my air pods which I actually got as a present Im constantly going like this to get them in perfectly and then I get complaints from people as Im continuously adjusting them which is a pain and then on top of that if you guys have ever used air pods you know how sensitive they are you move it the wrong way and Apple thinks youre youre clicking the bottom and disconnecting your call and who wants that Ive hung up on my Nana way too much these days and this is a product to ensure that doesnt happen 1195 a reminder guys Ive made it very easy for you Matts daily dealscom for the deals the blogs the coupons and some of the best headphone deals you will ever see if you liked what you saw again please give me a thumbs up it helps me know what to do for my next video so Im saving you money not

seth and today im unboxing the followup to one of the greatest wireless headphones of all time the sony wh1000xm3s and if you dont already know which headphones im talking about im talking about the sony wh1000xm4s and no if youre wondering this isnt them this is my old set of xm3s here are the xm4s and i happen to get them a day early so why dont we open up the sony wh1000xm4s and find out if theyre worthy improvement over the xm3s but before we get into these i want to give you all a huge thank you for tuning in to todays video whether you came from my main channel or you just found me on youtube somehow thank you so much for being here and make sure to hit that subscribe button if you havent yet but ive got to say for me personally this is one of my most anticipated pieces of tech for 2020 this is a pair of headphones that ive been looking forward to for almost two years at this point ever since the xm3s came out so why dont i rip off this outer plastic and well take a quick look at the outside of the box im not kidding ive genuinely been really really excited for these headphones i just i cant wait to actually listen to them i cant wait to have all the extra features im stoked so majority of the outside of the box comes with this really nice matte textured finish which feels really nice to the touch of course the main image on the front of the box are the headphones themselves which lets be honest look just like the xm3s and then off to the side of the box weve got sonys logo the name of the headphones and then on the bottom some information about the battery life bluetooth capabilities and the fact that it has alexa and google voice google assistant is what i meant i called the google voice didnt i regardless its got all the smart assistants if you choose to use them i dont usually use them on my headphones personally but thats up to you then on the back of the box youve got a ton of different information about the headphones themselves and also give you some links to download apps that can work with the headphones like the sony headphones connect app i obviously already have that app because i have the xm3s and other than an update i think i should be pretty much good to go i actually dont even know if i need to update the app ill check before we actually try and sync up the headphones but im pretty sure its already good the sony wh1000xm4 is released tomorrow august 18th for a retail price of 349 bucks which to be honest is expensive but its pretty much in line with all of the other headphones that are just as premium and have just as many features so why dont we finally pop this guy open and see it for the first time because i havent seen this in person yet and im stoked so the first thing youll see inside the box is the easy setup information download the app power on your headphones great lets put this top part down and then if you open up this flap youll see the headphone case itself now i actually lost the headphone case for the xm3 so from what i remember this looks almost exactly the same as the xm3s headphone case but i could be wrong underneath the headphone case youve got some information about the headphones themselves youve got the warranty information and i believe the instruction manual as well or maybe thats just more warranty information no its the reference guide weve got the reference guide in here but other than that thats everything thats inside the box look at that looking sexy af man i love these im not blown away though i mean they look just like the headphones that im wearing right now but hey if it aint broke dont fix it actually my xm3s did break you may be able to see that little crack right there which ive heard is actually a pretty common problem and ive heard that sony did actually beef up the plastic around that area so that wouldnt happen on the xm4s that didnt sound good but back to the unboxing before we actually get to the headphones themselves lets pull out the cables that come with it which i believe are an aux cable right here and then also a airline adapter from what i remember its the same accessories it came with the xm3s again i lost those accessories too so i dont remember for sure and then it looks like the last accessory youve got inside the bag is the usbc charger but they do not give you a wall wart you have to use your phones charger or something like that its also really short which is kind of a bummer i wish they gave you a longer one but it is what it is but here they are the sony xm4 is looking really nice with some extra padding around the top and some beefier plastic hinges other than that though the only real changes to the exterior of the headphones are changing the color of this logo right down here moving some of the buttons around adding a couple more mics and then also adding a proximity sensor inside the left earcup they really do look very very similar but what makes these headphones special is the fact that theyve got a bunch of new internal changes that should make the experience of wearing these headphones a little bit better the first and most exciting change at least for me on the xm4s is the fact that you can now pair two different devices on the xm3s you could only have one device paired at a time and for me the time that i would be using these headphones the most is when i was working or traveling and the problem that i would have most often is that i would be editing a video on my laptop and then get a call on my phone or id be listening to music on my phone and then id really quickly need to make a change or do something on my laptop and id have to actually physically go into the bluetooth settings every time i wanted to switch between devices and change it manually but now it syncs up with two different devices so if im working on my computer and then i get a call on my phone i can automatically switch over without any issues to be honest thats a feature that bose has had for years and thats the reason why i even considered switching from my xm3s over to a pair of bows which i didnt end up doing but i was very very close to doing now to be honest the reason why i didnt switch from my xm3s to a pair of bose headphones was because the noise cancelling was so excellent and ive heard that its gotten even better on the xm4s in addition to multiple device pairing youve got a feature called speak the chat which allows you to actually put the headphones on and then start talking and your music will hear it and automatically stop and not only that but itll also allow for some mic pass through so you can hear whats going on around you so you can have short conversations with people without taking off your headphones these headphones arent turned on though so i cant really hear anything because they already block out a huge amount of sound by just being on your ears that being said why dont we turn them on and pair them and see how they sound so now theyre connected to my phone let me really quickly check the app and see if theres any new features that i just didnt know about there is actually an update great start setup and fully enjoy functions of the headphones 360 reality audio setup this is to optimize the 360 reality audio sound experience for you to enjoy an audio immersion experience as real as a live performance lets check it out try the sample music below to hear the difference lets do it thats all right okay lets hear 360 audio thats better that is cool though i can hear it behind me and now in front of me okay 360 audio is all right im mad at that they sound great its still updating so they dont have the newest software setting but they sound good and the noise canceling on these sounds incredible i mean i cant say for sure if it sounds better than the xm3s yet because i havent had a chance to actually test them out yet but i will come out with a full review of these headphones in the next couple days and let you know really what my experience has been oh this is cool this was the setting that i was talking about where you could talk and it would pause music and you could hear yourself thats awesome another feature is that if you take off the headphones theyll stop playing music thats actually one of the reasons for this proximity sensor in the left ear cup comfort wise though they do feel really really nice obviously its a similar design so its going to feel similar to the xm3s but they really did add more padding in the top which i appreciated and it felt like it was a little bit softer around my ears i could just be imagining that or they could have added more padding around the ears im not 100 sure some other awesome features of the xm4s which arent really new from the xm3s but are still there on the xm4s and are still just as great are the 30 hour battery life and the 10 minute 5 hour charging which ive got to say is a lifesaver when it comes to traveling i never had any battery life issues with the xm3s and i would expect that the xm4s are going to be just as good one new feature that im actually really excited about on the xm4s is that apparently if you hold your right hand up to the right ear cup it pauses the music so you can have conversations with people and in addition to pausing the music it also allows for that mic pass through so you can better hear whats going on around you i know that almost seems redundant because you already have the speak to chat feature but what it does allow you to do is listen to announcements at places like the airport oh two other things that i forgot to mention were one you still have the touch controls on the side of the headphones whether you like them or whether you dont like them theyre still there and not only that but sony also added some more external mics on the headphones so call quality should sound a little bit better thats something that i havent tested personally but thats something that i definitely will test when i give these headphones a full review overall though in the couple of minutes that ive had these headphones and tested them out ive been really impressed now are they a worthy upgrade over the xm3s i would say so if youre willing to upgrade headphones and willing to spend another 350 on a new set of headphones theyre not like groundbreakingly different but they do improve on some pain points that i had with the xm3 so for me personally as someone who wanted to upgrade to a newer pair of headphones this was perfect if you already have a pair of xm3s and you dont feel like spending the money though or you want to buy a pair of xm3s now that theyre on discount that might actually be the way to go instead of grabbing a new pair of xm4s but with that we wrap up the unboxing of the sony wh1000xm4s now i would love to know your thoughts on these headphones and whether youre considering picking up a pair for yourself so let me know in the comment section down below also if youre looking to grab a pair of these headphones for yourself dont forget to stay tuned for the review which is coming out in the next couple days because once ive actually had a chance to try out these headphones for myself ill be really excited to tell you all the things that i love and dont love about these new headphones but as always thank you so much for watching make sure to

all of a sudden youre in the market again case in point lead Jabra elite 85h wireless headphones Im Erin for tech gadgets Canada comm and I have tried a lot of Jabra products going all the way back to my first bone conduction wireless bluetooth headset for the car Ive got to say Ive always been impressed with Jabra products I received a pair of the Jabra elite 85h headphones recently in the black color here to test and review in my home and at the office and Ill tell you what I found an early heads up though that if you end up liking this video and finding it helpful too please hit that like button and give me a sub because it does help me keep making more videos that I hope everyone out there can watch enjoy and learn from Jabra elite 85h are fully wireless over ear headphones that use bluetooth to connect to your smartphone tablet or device theres a multifunction button that lets you play or pause without needing your phone and you can use the headphones to summon your digital assistant  to get these phones set up just turn them on as soon as you put them on your ears youll hear a voice prompt telling you to go to your phones bluetooth menu and choose the Jabra elite 85h from your menu I was connected in seconds with just a single click you can connect these headphones to more than one device at a time and to a phone tablet or a computer whats in the box what comes in the box is rather impressive you get a large leather look carrying case that comes complete with a handful of Handy accessories like an aux cord if you want to use these in Wired mode a charging cable and a dual aux airplane jack for use on some older airplane models the first thing I noticed about these headphones is that the ear cups are huge now not so much from the outside but it feels like there is a ton of real estate on the inside for your ears at the same time there is plenty of cushiony thick padding yes these headphones are ultra padded and as soon as you put them on youre going to notice they have killer noise isolation properties now theres a difference between noise cancelling and noise isolation when it comes to wireless bluetooth headphones noise isolation is the act of physically isolating your ears from outside sound think phat padding on over ear headphones or a great seal on in the ear Wireless head phones noise cancellation on the other hand uses digital algorithms to listen for outside noise than to block it out by creating a digital mask over that sound bleed well both of these technologies can be effective noise canceling technology tends to be the more expensive so your budget may determine what you choose now these headphones also have noise canceling technology Jabra calls it smart active noise cancellation before we get to that we will want to talk about the Jabra app which youll need to get the most from these headphones Jabra has an app that allows you to get finer control over your headphones using the app you can adjust many the features of your headphones including the noise cancellation sound levels including equalization and you can even hunt down your headphones if theyre lost I will say I found the app finicky nine times out of ten Id try to get the app to connect to the headphones to use some of the features but the app wasnt seeing the headphones and it was telling me to reconnect even though I had music already playing it was really only able to get the app to connect randomly and infrequently which was frustrating when it comes to music presets there are six music preset settings available on your Jabra elite 85h theres default bass boost smooth speech treble boost and energized the difference between these settings is minimal to my ear well the bass boost is easiest to pick out the rest seemed quite similar I gave the headphones to a coworker and asked her if she noticed any differences while I was switching up the modes and she really only noticed treble boost saying it sounded like the bass got nixed theres also an equalization setting in this app using the sound plus app you can adjust audio settings to fine tune your bass midrange and treble by dragging your finger along the line the adjustments are far more noticeable than using the presets you can really finetune your sound and get lots more bass treble or just configure the sound however you like it these headphones have a feature that until now Ive only seen in Apple headphones its called find my Jabra when enabled using the Jabra sound plus app you can see exactly where on a map your headphones last turned on and connected to bluetooth this feature works great and can help you find your headphones if youve forgotten them stay at the office or somewhere else another feature I really liked is the on ear detection on your detection can tell when youve placed the headphones on your ears and when you take them off I found this setting worked great and helped preserve my battery life it also made it easy to listen to podcasts at the office where interruptions happen frequently now lets talk about the noise cancellation and the ambient functions using the Jabra elite 85h noise canceling feature creates a great cone of silence around you it really does keep everything happening outside you from bleeding in from chatty coworkers to barking dogs or the neighbors lawn mower all of those things were successfully blocked out during my testing on the other hand here through is a cool feature that lets you allow outside noise into the headphones now why well this is designed to make you more aware of your surroundings when youre maybe walking in busy areas commuting or you just need to keep your ears on whats happening around you turning this feature on in the sound Plus app lets you hear nearly everything happening around you while blending that sound appropriately with your music or your audio so you get both at once this feature works really well and provides a good balance of outside ambient noise and music and helps you feel safer and less isolated plus using the app you can adjust how much ambient noise to let in from lots to almost none these headphones are made to last and last when it comes to battery life Jabra says the elite 85 H will give you 36 hours of battery life even with the active noise cancellation switched on I can say accidentally left the headphones on and connected to my phone with music playing all day and I still got many more days of battery life from them after I finally shut them down plus with fast charging you can get five hours of battery life from just 15 minutes of charging after going through all those features its easy to almost forget about the primary feature and thats the sound quality Im happy to report that these headphones sound great the Jabra elite 85 H sound really clear and its easy to pick up on small details in the music like drumsticks on the rim claps or breaths without fussing with the equalizer you get a very even sound that doesnt lean too hard in any direction whether thats high or low and with the ability to customize and finetune your audio you can truly get a perfect sound now when it comes to casts the voices are clear and the overall sound is really wellbalanced watching videos was great too when I was watching YouTube there was no lag between the audio and the video as I have found on some other wireless headphones overall I found that these are great headphones theyre comfortable they sound really good and theyre versatile thanks to that wired Jack option if there were any cons its probably that I found the preset audio settings werent very robust but I dont have any hesitation whatsoever in recommending the Jabra elite 85h overall if youre looking for a new set of premium headphones these headphones here sell for about 400 dollars Canadian from places like Best Buy and from Amazon if you want to read more about them head over to tech gadgets Canada comm where Ive got a

"channel_id": "UCO4ZTteyr13tn2rG5hLu8pg", "collection_date": "20201007 102248055102", "video_id": "309BXbshpW0", "Closed Captions": " alright guys so today were gonna check out the brand new Razer Opus headphones now this is not the normal gaming style headphone from Razer in fact this is a THX certified Wireless active noisecancelling pair of headphones so this is more geared towards being the one pair of headphones that you can use for everything and with them being THX certified these would be really good for watching movies and different types of media so if youre looking for a pair of headphones and you dont want to spend the price tag of the sony WH 1000 XM 3s or the bose qc25 s were gonna see if the Razer Opus is worth the 200 price tag but lets start with the fact that they are available in black and midnight blue so unlike other Razer products theyre not available in bright neon colors it doesnt have the usual neon green and I have the midnight blue model here which really just kind of looks like a lighter black its hard to even tell that its blue so you can tell theyre trying to be real subtle about the colors and theyre also trying to be real subtle about the design theres not a whole lot of big branding going on its very simple and I really like the look of these now as far as some of the technology thats in here they do have an app that works with the headphones and really the only benefit that I see to having the app is it has different preset EQ settings that are builtin but I found that the thx setting thats on these right out of the box was the one that I preferred anyway so outside of that I really dont see a benefit to having the app now these are Bluetooth 50 they do have app techs and AAC playback and as far as the battery life youre going to get around 25 hours of use on a single charge so its not up there with some of the 40 hours that Ive seen on other headphones but 25 hours is gonna get most people through a week before needing to charge these so I think the battery life is more than okay and I dont think many people would complain now moving over to looking at what you get in the Box the first thing I want to point out is I think the box itself even has a really nice premium look to it and the first thing youre gonna see inside the box is the carrying case which is a very nice hard carrying case its kind of flat like the bows and the so knees which basically means that the headphones just kind of fold down and fit in the case that way but it is a nice looking case and it wont take up a lot of space in your bag they are very lightweight I did notice because of the plastic build if you do twist these a little bit you will notice some slight creaking it doesnt worry me that these are gonna break but it is kind of annoying that it makes these sounds now as far as the padding I feel like the headband has more than enough padding because of the headphones being so light its one of those that you can really kind of forget that you even have them on they dont really have a tight clamp force on them but they do say on the head very well and I found that the padding on the ear pads was also really nice because it has the memory foam cushions in it and it really just kind of formed around my ears and felt very soft now one thing that definitely threw me off is I kind of expected these to have touch controls considering that seems to be on a lot of the more modern headphones but razer decided to go back to actual physical button controls which I personally prefer just because the swipe controls always kind of seem inconsistent and sometimes you can just accidentally do something that you dont really mean to do but as far as on the headphones on the left side you have your power button you also have a noise canceling  ambient mode button and ambient mode on these work very well so if you just kind of press and hold it the microphones will bring in your surroundings and you just kind of carry on a conversation or hear whats going on around you without actually taking off the headphones now I really would have liked to have seen the headphones have different levels of noise canceling but you really just have noise canceling on or off and the noise canceling on these I think do a very good job now its definitely not up to the Sony or Bose standards as far as noise cancelling goes I would say that its about 80 of what those are capable of but I think for the price tag youre still getting really nice noise cancelling considering these dont cost as much as the Sony or Bose now also on the left side you have an input for your threeandahalf millimeter cable which means that you can use these as a normal wired pair of headphones if you want to use them that way and then theres also a USB C input which is how you would charge these so inside the box you are getting the three half millimeter cable and the USBC cable and theyve also included a USB adapter so that you can charge these like if youre gonna plug them into your PC or into a wall outlet now other than that they have included an airline adapter and then the only other controls are on the right hand side that is where your controls for your play your pause skipping your tracks forward going backwards and even your volume up and volume down so it is really simple when it comes to the controls its not very complex and its definitely easy to get a hold of another huge bonus with these and one feature that I like is these also have these smart sensors so that when you take the headphones off they will automatically pause and then when you put them back on they will automatically resume now this is a feature that you see in most noise cancelling headphones and I think that is done very well here now as far as the microphones on the Opus I think they did a pretty decent job overall but you guys can be a judge by listening to a test here so here is a mic test using the Razer Opus I think it does a fairly decent job of picking up my voice but this is what it would sound like if you were to take a call so now lets talk about the sound the sound is the one thing that completely surprised me about these because most of my history with Razer products usually consist of overpowering bass there are usually boomy headphones and youre lucky to get a lot of clarity out of them but you definitely get a lot of impact and what these do is focus a lot on the clarity so vocals come through very nicely the detail and instruments are nice and clean and you can hear dialogue if youre gonna watch movies or hear subtle things that a lot of other headphones miss these do an excellent job of picking up details the bass is nice and clean its really accurate its just not what I expected out of a razer product and comparing these two these Sonys the Sonys have a lot more bass but I feel the Razer has a lot more clarity so its kind of hard to compare these to the Sonys because in my opinion this is a completely different style of sound coming out of these headphones now the more you turn the volume up the more impactful the bass does get but you can tell that theyre leaning towards being accurate felt like the dialogue and movies came through extremely well it was really easy to tell where things are coming from so the soundstage and the sound imaging on these are just excellent I really enjoyed listening to these and I honestly think that I kind of leaned more towards using these because of the clarity that they had and now if youre somebody that likes overpowering bass or you like that subwoofer style bass to me these just dont deliver on that front but if you like a lot more clarity if you like a pair of headphones that lean a little more towards accuracy and has noise cancelling this is actually an excellent pair of headphones now as far as some of my cons with these I really would have liked to have seen the build quality be a little bit better now Im not worried that these are gonna break but Im not a huge fan of when my headphones start to creak if I kind of twist them a little bit and the only other thing outside of that is I really would have liked to have seen the app have a little bit more options when it comes to noise cancelling and same thing with the headphones you just have noise cancelling on or off when you have pairs like the Sony that has different levels of noise cancelling and even like the Bose 700 that has I believe 10 or maybe 15 different levels of noise cancelling with the razor you just get it on or off and I feel like youre kind of limited so I think the 200 price tag is more than warranted here especially getting the THX certified which to me sounds excellent with games and with movies and I really enjoyed the sound signature with the music that I listened to which is everything I think these fit all different types of situations and the 200 price tag youre getting a lot for the money but

audio technica ath m50x bTW this is the bluetooth version of the studio monitor headphones and in this video Im gonna be doing a longterm review of these awesome headphones with some pros and some cons so lets get into it before I begin this video of course smash the like button and subscribe you know what to do down below and also if you like the shirt check out my shop at aqua dot shop you can find all my merch there so lets talk about these headphones so I bought the audio technica ath m50x BTW first of all that is way too long of a headphones title like they just need to call it like headphones Pro anyway the name of these headphones is really long but the quality of these is really great they run about two hundred dollars right now theyre actually 180 on Amazon Ill leave a link to that in the description below but yeah Ive been using these headphones for studio monitoring for making music and just for general listening and watching movies and that kind of thing so the most important thing to me in a pair of headphones is by far the audio quality so lets talk about that first in terms of audio quality I would give these headphones maybe an 85 out of 10 theyre really really good they definitely have a little bit of bass response and they go pretty deep into the sub bass but theyre definitely not super rumbly when it comes to really deep frequencies the highs are nice and sparkly and they have a very nice kind of stereo width when you listen to them you can hear all kinds of details flying in and out from left to right its just very pleasing to listen to these especially for a long period of time sometimes the high trebles can be a little sharp in these like sometimes the S noses and the high hats cymbals that kind of stuff can be a little too edgy like a little too crispy for my personal taste but if you like a really sparkly treble kind of sound in your headphones youre really gonna like these the cons of the sound quality on these I would say is in the mids to the mid lows theres not a super thick sound to these the bass is definitely there its just not very punchy so in general I do like the sound of these I just wish there was a little more you know mids and mid low sin and a little bit more bass but then again Im usually not using these for really crazy listening where I want the most Bumi and you know theatric kind of sound Im mostly amusing these when Im making music when Im using them as a studio monitor I really like the aesthetic of these I do think they look kind of huge when theyre on my head they kind of jet out wide but they do have a lot of give to them you know they dont feel like theyre going to break theyre made of this kind of matte plastic type of feel with a little bit of this metal on the inside and I do like the band like theres this nice kind of cushion that I do enjoy and overall theyre pretty comfortable to wear they fit right on my head pretty nicely and I do wear these obviously with glasses underneath and one thing I can say thats a little bit of a negative but this isnt so much these headphones its just kind of over the ear headphones in general is they do press down on my glasses a little bit and into my head so I can actually create like a headache kind of feel for me and my head gets a little hot under these theres not a whole lot of airflow going in and out because these are closed back headphones and you know I live in Texas yall it is hot here so I do have to take these off after about an hour or thirty minutes or something like that just to cool my ears off a little bit because they do get a little moist a little sweaty but I do like that the sound signature on these its so even and its so flat it just sounds very pleasant to listen to like I said so it doesnt really feel like these are very fatiguing on my ears I can listen to these for hours at a time while I do get hot theyre not very fatiguing when it comes to the sound which is a really good thing one thing I do wish these actually came with especially at the price point of about 200 is I wish audiotechnica threw in a hardshell case for these but I do appreciate that you can fold them up like this and theyre pretty compact if youre traveling a lot theyre really awesome for that Ive used these for DJing several times too these definitely dont sound like noise cancelling headphones because youre not always cancelling headphones but they do isolate your environment noises a little bit when you put them on so you can kind of focus in on your music project and that leads me to the next subject which is the wireless capability of these these use bluetooth 50 which means theyre lower power than other previous models or versions of Bluetooth and the battery on these things is awesome Audio Technica says these headphones will last about 40 hours on one charge these lasts like forever I barely even have to charge these maybe once a month and Im talking about using it for at least an hour a day but there is a downfall of the charging mechanism and that is these headphones use micro USB that alone to me kind of dates these a little bit not the end of the world its just kind of annoying and it makes these seem kind of less premium for some reason so when it comes to Bluetooth connectivity the Bluetooth 50 works really well with this I dont experience much latency or lag when it comes to playing music or videos even watching YouTube I dont hear any kind of sync issues with these so thats really good but the big kind of downfall of the Bluetooth on these is they only pair with one device at a time and they cant easily be transferred from device to device you have to manually go into your Bluetooth settings every time you want to change the device youre using these with and disconnect these from that device and then connect them manually to the next device which is not a huge deal like its not the end of the world but sometimes Ill forget which device Im using these on and Ill turn them on and Ill hear the little beep that says its paired with the device but I wont remember which device its on you know is it on my iPad is it on my laptop my phone so I have to go into each device and feel like that I use it on this device that I use it on that like theres no manual bluetooth pairing button on here where I can just unpair this with one device remotely and then just pair it with another device that Im already holding so I do wish there was some kind of pairing button on these that would make it a lot easier to be able to switch this from device to device there are some multifunction buttons on these headphones though like a volume up and volume down and then theres a multifunction button in the middle theyre very easy to use the ease of use is amazing on these you just kind of turn them on theyre paired theyre ready to go pairing is usually pretty fast with bluetooth 50 so thats not really an issue and while you can use these with a wire obviously because there is a 35 millimeter headphone jack on there but I prefer to use them most of the time with bluetooth I like having that wireless capability where I can just walk away with these headphones on listen to I mix and then come back make a change and then walk away and paste thats kind of my weird process but it works really well for that so I do end up using these on Bluetooth about ninetyfive percent of the time and I dont notice a huge difference when it comes to audio quality between using Bluetooth versus using a cable situation which is a really good thing because sometimes youll turn on bluetooth on wireless headphones and then all of a sudden the audio quality will change or you wont hear as much bass or treble and it sounds like a more compressed sound but seriously I cannot tell almost any difference between the wired version of these or the Bluetooth version which is a huge positive and in conclusion I do think that are an awesome deal even at 200 I actually found an open box version of these I think for about 129 and at that price these are an absolute steal I think in terms of audio quality build quality the accuracy of frequencies the overall design is pretty nice the Bluetooth functionality is super awesome I love being able to use these wirelessly it makes a huge difference in my process however switching devices on these is a pain in the rump shaker I wish these pick connect to a couple devices at the same time so I can kind of seamlessly switch back and forth thats not the end of the world though and I still think these are an awesome value so let me know what you think in the comments of these headphones having used them do you have other recommendations for other Bluetooth headphones that you think are better than the 80 H and 50 X bTW its so long anyway I love these headphones I hope you enjoyed this video if it was helpful smash the like button and the subscribe button the notification though also if you want to

speakers and pretty much everything in between today we have their h19 IPO Bluetooth wireless anc headphones at about 40 to 45 US dollars they look super affordable but we need to see if theyre actually worth it the headphones come in a small cardboard box with a micro USB charging cable 35 millimeter cable that can be used if you run out of battery power a small user manual and a soft carrying bag I want to start this review by talking about comfort because wireless headphones like these tend to be something that people wear often and for long periods of time while theyre traveling commuting exercising and all sorts of stuff like that so if theyre not comfortable then you know whats the point so right away we can see this nice thick foam padding on the ear cups its really quite soft and comfortable and theres some more of it up top on the headband which is also nice so it is soft and comfortable up against your skin but at the same time the ear cups are actually on the small side and what that means is depending on your ear size they might sit on top of your ear as opposed to around them and for some people that might make for an uncomfortable situation so just be aware of that but thats a compromise or a tradeoff for such a small and compact footprint which helps with portability so its not all bad and I think if youre looking for something thats gonna be subtle that you can wear every day and kind of blend in nothing crazy thats gonna stand out and have people stare at you and think youre communicating with the International Space Station or something like that then this is a good option these deliver that portability and nice small footprint and subtle look the ear cups have both tilt and swivel movement which should help fit a variety of different ear and head shapes and the headbands adjustable as well so it should fit most people even when wearing a hat you can also fold the ear cups inward to reduce the size even further to make for super easy storage and carrying the entire package is pretty lightweight at just 240 grams which I guess isnt surprising considering theyre made mostly from plastic but they do feel pretty solid in the hand and that gives me the impression that they should be able to withstand a little bit of abuse without falling apart all of the controls are located on the bottom of the ear cups and theyre actually pretty easy to find even when youre wearing the headphones on the left side theres a 35 millimeter jack and the ANC switch and on the right theres some volume buttons d function power button and micro USB charging port and a builtin microphone pairing the headphones with your Bluetooth devices as easy as powering them on and then selecting mpow h19 IPO in your Bluetooth settings the large 40 millimeter drivers deliver pretty good sound quality for a pair of wireless headphones in this price range I mean its nowhere near the quality that you can get from some of those big expensive premium options out there but thats alright because these are just 40 bucks and I think a lot of people are going to be completely satisfied with the sound quality that these are able to deliver one of the main features on these is anc or active noise cancellation and what that does is it tries to remove some of the background noise like traffic or the sounded jet engines when youre on a plane and stuff like that and it actually works pretty well but I happen to notice that when ANC is turned on the audio playback actually sounds better so I chose to leave it on pretty much all of the time while I was testing these now there are a couple of issues with this though the first is that when ANC is turned on battery life is reduced quite a bit and the second thing is I noticed this weird hissing sound when you have ANC turned on and theres no audio playback coming through the headphones now that part might not be a huge deal because if youre wearing the headphones youre probably listening to something and not just having dead air in the background so you might not notice that as much battery life serrated at 35 hours but thats with ansi turned off and when you turn and see on like I said before thats gonna take quite a bit of a hit how much of a hit is hard to say I tested these probably for about 10 hours with an C turned on and they were still going strong so its not gonna be too bad but one of the other things you can do if you do run out of power is they do support a little bit of a quick charge function where 10 minutes of charging is supposed to give you 25 hours of playback so theres that and theres also that 35 millimeter audio cable where if you dont mind plugging them into your device you can just use them even if the battery is completely dead now the builtin mic on these was just designed to function for basic phone calls and really nothing more so dont expect amazing quality thats for sure I did test it and it basically sounded like when youre talking to somebody through speakerphone the quality was pretty low so I mean I guess thats fine for phone calls but thats about it if you want to use these for gaming or any kind of audio recording on your computer or laptop I would definitely recommend getting a separate microphone so that you can get better quality so the bottom line is that the mpow h19 IPO wireless anc headphones deliver pretty good sound quality and they have active noise cancellation that actually happens to do a pretty good job and theyre packaged in this nice clean sleek small and lightweight design its nice and its portable and they sell for about forty to forty five US dollars on amazon at the time of this recording which i think is a really good price for a set of wireless headphones with all of these

engineered by JBL here is what the headphones look like so lets talk a little bit about the features it has the twist lock which well get into and Ill explain what it is durable built of course these are long lasting sweat proof so if youre a gym addict do know what that means so sweat proof for active use JBL sound but three miscellaneous buttons and this is what its talking about right here in these three buttons they control volume music and calls these are also compatible with iOS or Android what that means is basically if you were to purchase these headsets and you want to record your progress which one of the easiest ways to for you to do it is to just download this application which is called record chord is basically an application that you can download which collects your data and provides 247 view of your daily progress that goals track activity and connect with your friends and absolutely and Im having an Apple watch or a Fitbit band you can just use these headphones and synchronize down we have this app and keep track of your progress simple its up so I kind of like that technology that JBL just came out with now lets open the ball and here it is the statement by JBL audio engineering can meet Under Armor standard for premium performance to create the ultimate sports headphones I am going to go ahead and take these out at the box and lovely packaging so here is a little pouch which is really nice you know in it so it comes with the USB which is red which matches he had sucks using these from my gym so once I get done with them Ill be just throwing them in there and then you just throw the pouch in your gym bag and just safe and sound so it comes with the manual the warranty the user guide it also comes with different sizes of earbuds so you can select the tip of your size according to your ear and it also has small medium large 4 5 6 7 8 so these are different sizes and all these packages has these little earbuds in them but you can have the perfect tip eyes for the ears Im gonna take these out is it a forced Wireless and look at this cutaway for a little bit just to show you guys what it looks like and so so you guys can see it does have the twist lock so basically this right here this ear right here you just put this in in your ear and then you twist them to lock them inside your ear so they dont fall while youre running especially if youre using them for gym which Ill be doing yeah and then you just throw these in your pouch like such and then put this pouch in your gym bag and youre ready to go so for all of you who are watching this who will be using the youth headsets for your gym and if you havent purchased yours I would recommend for you to invest a little bit more money and you can purchase the sports wireless heart rate so a product by Under Armour and engineered by JBL theyre just picked at all its more expensive but they controlled your heart rate these are retailed at 149 dollars at JBLs website now the other ones are 199 dollars but they actually controlled the heart rate and to me I think Harvard is really important especially if youre using the headphones for your workouts so if you if you dont have something like the Fitbit or the Apple watch to where you can record and monitor your heart rate that would be one thing that you might want to look into that you may want to instead of investing 149 mic one invest hundred and 99 and get those its the same product same engineered by a GTV all same stuff but it attracts a performance along with the heartrate and so thats the only thing that I wanted to talk to you guys about other than that everything stays the same in the new ones 399 one these are censored and you can link them to your UA band thats about it nothing changes everything stays the same the sound the quality the performance everything stays the same the only thing changes its your heartrate so with that being said guys I hope this video was informative and helpful if it was please give me a thumbs up if you guys have any comments or questions to relate them at the comment section below I sure will bring you lots more until then to Anish here thank you for watching

headphones is their luxury feel and look and had compact they are and they even they even fold up even smaller so they are ideal for traveling with now Ive been wearing these headphones on my head for a few days now and they are very comfortable in fact the most comfortable headphones that I bought so far the only downside well theres a couple of downsides is that Ive often a foot in each you ease to do gets a bit wall and the other thing is that if you do move your head suddenly or stoop over they have got a tendency to slip off your head so wouldnt recommend these headphones if youre going to be used using them at the gym but for everyday use apart from that perfectly fine and Im really quite impressed with the look and feel of these headphones Music as you can see theres plenty of cushioning under the headband Music the ear cushions have lots of padding too which really does make these headphones very comfortable to wear this cushioning also provides some significant passive ambient noise reduction and you can fold these ear cushions inwards for easy transportation of the headphones the volume controls are easy to operate and the sound quality of these headphones in my opinion is excellent with just the right balance of mids triples and lows Music I was very impressed with the battery life which is quoted as 15 hours from a full charge Music both include a backup audio cable so you can still use your Bose headphones wired if the battery is flat you can even store your headphones and cables together in the included pouch Music the Bluetooth connectivity is fast and efficient and voice prompts guide you through the bluetooth pairing procedure to connect to a new device all you need to do is slide the power Bluetooth button all the way up and till you until you hear ready to pair or you see the blue blinking Bluetooth icon now you can also connect two devices simultaneously to these headphones and all you need to do is just play the media on the device that you want to hear the music from while porting the other one this has worked well for myself when switching between my laptop and my iPhone 8 but unfortunately it didnt work when I tried to switch between my smart tv to my laptop or my iPhone I was very impressed with the Bluetooth range on these headphones its quoted as up to 9 meters and I used these headphones all around my home and only started to lose the signal when I was at my front door which was probably about 9 meters from where my iPhone was situated also when I did get out of range real spending on a Bluetooth call the call immediately reconnected when I came back into the range and I could carry on with the conversation you Music hello how are you Im good  thanks house has the same quality thats great your same quality is great  okay let me try one more thing Im gonna try and switch the the call for my headphones to the iPhone so just bear with me I want to press the function button for 3 seconds hello hello yeah okay thats what Ill just put your night speaker okay so let me switch you back to my headphones just bear with me a second yep just paste the function button three times these seconds of me hello yep okay thats great thats worked okay thanks a lot I thought Ill end the call thank you I get by Music there you go so I shout out how good is that receiving Bluetooth calls and the music resumes after the calls ending and you can also transfer the call from your headphones back to your smart phone and then switch it back again these posts are near headphones are currently retailing on amazoncom for about one hundred and seventy dollars and on Amazon Cody at UK for about one hundred nine pound do I think theyre worth buying yes I definitely do and he fires to score them out of five Id probably

at the aftershocks arrow pecs headphones so aftershocks are a company that specialized in bone conduction headphones and they released their first set of headphones in 2012 so lets take a look inside the box so it comes really nicely packaged youve got the headphones here as well as yeah bit of accessories here as well so first of all well have a look whats in the accessory bag so youve got a nice little storage case that it comes with here so when youre not using them you can put them nicely in your rucksack or your handbag or whatever they come with two microUSB cables so this is especially great if you leave one of them in the office and one of them at home you dont have to worry about transporting the cable to and from so Im moving on to the headphones themselves bone conduction headphones are great because it means that you can listen to your favorite music or podcasts whatever youre doing and youre still able to hear the surrounding noise so whether youre running swimming in the office and you still want to be a part of a part of the conversation then yeah these are perfect for those situations so the idea with these is that they work through bone conduction through your cheek bones so Ill put some one for example they just fit my feet not in not into your actual width itself but just onto your cheek theyre wireless you dont have to worry about why is getting in the way when youre running or cycling for example its hardly feels like youre wearing them at all so these headphones are just 26 grams and that makes them the lightest headphones that aftershokz make and yeah like I say it doesnt feel like Im wearing them anything at all theyre super small nice and lightweight and yeah perfect for transporting these headphones have a great sound quality thanks to the premium pitch two plus and give an improved dynamic bass range so no matter what sort of music youre listening to youll still get a really good quality audio feel for them so these headphones are really quite loud even though they dont go through your ears but through your bones and the bone conduction transducer is actually 50 smaller than that of the previous model and when youre wearing them and listening to music and people that are around you arent able to hear the music that youre listening to you see if youre listening on public transport for example people are going to be annoyed that they can hear you your music as well even though they dont feed into your ears directly so the charging on these is done through this little bit here just attaches on there and then youve got the micro USB that can go into like a USB plug youve got two little buttons on there so thats the sound up or down and you can also skip tracks on there listen to music these headphones come with an eight hours playing time and a 10 hour standby time and thats after a full charge also have a dual cancelling microphone so theres a microphone am built so if youre using a call through bluetooth with them the other person on the end of the call will be able to hear you nice and clearly and you dont have to worry about that so you can use them wash or training or running if you need to take a call then you can do so they have a wireless range of up to 33 feet or 10 meters and I only take two hours to fully charge these headphones come with a 2year warranty and another little point that I really like about them is that theyve got a silicone kind of casing so if you do sweat whilst wearing them you can just wipe clean really really easy and the silicone casing also adds a little bit of extra grip when wearing them so that after shots arrow pecs are a clear step forward from the previous model Ive actually been using these over the last couple of weeks and have been impressed they fit on my head got quite small heads and havent found any issues with them slipping off when Ive been cycling or running so if youre looking for bone conduction headphones that give you the same sound quality as traditional ear buds then the aftershocks air effects a really good choice theyre comfortable lightweight it doesnt feel like youre wearing them at all the sound quality is huge and yeah a really really cool little bit of technology so let me know in the comments below if youve liked this video make sure you give it a big thumbs up and make sure you subscribe as well have more unboxing

ear headphones from ai ai ai at first glance they dont look like a 350 set of headphones but lets look what goes into these and see what theyre made of the team hu is considered a modular headphone meaning that you can change the setup depending on your needs thats the good news now the bad news is you do have to snap them together yourself its kind of like following in IKEA directions except its way simpler ai ai ai sent me the Alec answer ear pad model but for five dollars less you can have the leather pads Alec contra has a soft microfiber material and I was surprised at how comfortable the ear pads felt even after extended listening sessions there were times where I could feel the plastic driver against my ear you might not find that more supportive ear pads but overall I was really impressed with the comfort of the pads on the tma2 the diaphragm is made of 40 millimeter bio cellulose material which is often found in much more expensive headphones ai ai ai says the bio cellulose diaphragm provides a stiffer lighter and stronger material than regular PE T speaker units and allows soundproducing diaphragm to vibrate without the levels of distortion found in other speakers the headphones come with a PTX codec so the sound is about as close to CD quality as you can get through a Bluetooth to Vitus to power the tma2 press and hold the middle buttons for about 2 seconds to power off press and hold the top button for a few seconds to pair the tma2 with a device simply press and hold the top and bottom buttons for a few seconds once I got the hang of it connection to my devices was pretty easy the tma2 connected seamlessly to my iPhone every time I used it but with older Bluetooth devices I had a bit more trouble that was until I learned to delete all the previous devices from the headset before trying to connect them to new device to delete all previous devices press and hold all three buttons for a few seconds now lets go out on the street and see what other people think of them ok so youve tried out the aiaiaiai headphones what do you think of them theyre definitely very comfortable thats the initial read that I get from them sound quality is pretty good I wish it came with a little bit more bass but thats just my personal reference preference but besides that I think theyre a great pair of headphones ok do you have a namebrand pair I do have a namebrand pair do you pay about the same price as easy to go for three hundred and fifty dollars maybe not I dont think as expensive buy I could definitely tell that theres a definitely a quality of better quality in these headphones alright so what did you think of them they sounded really good I couldnt really hear anything else besides the music what it was playing which is really nice theyre really comfortable its really cushy it fits really well it like conforms to a head shape really nicely overall give it a good 10 out of 10 how was the sound come here dears definitely Maura I felt like it was like almost like a surround sound versus just listening to music I will thank you all right so you tried out the TMA chews and now what do you think well first theyre very comfortable to wear thats the first thing I know I have some at home that are of a different name brand and they are over time very uncomfortable but I feel like for a long period of time the padding is just right and it doesnt really feel like expressing my head theres enough settings there to make it adjustable enough to fit just about anybody but theyre really light which I thought translated into maybe not very expensive or not very conventional material I dont know but they theyre very light theyre almost transparent the only thing I would say is that when I put them a little bit towards the back they do slip but once on they feel really really solid and and what you think of the sound compared to the ones that you have they are really really precise in the midrange and in the highs I thought they really did a great job producing especially some older rock classics and even even newer rock classics I thought the drums and the guitar and the voices and even the high part of the cymbals sounded great the bass was not as present as they are with the said I have at home but I sometimes think the said I have at home kind of his disproportionate tries to blow up the bass you know maybe more than it should the sound was precise though and I said I thought all of it was represented very well even at the low end but I thought I could have a little more punch in the low end considering they got so much apparatus around your head I kind of expect usually when I put on a full set of headphones Im going to get a little bit more of the lower end presence so you can see the consensuses that the tma2 sound great are really comfortable pair easily two cell phones and our overall really good pair of headphones the headphones have a listed runtime of 16 hours from a single charge but for me the battery held out longer than I had time to listen to them in one session the tma2 come with a twoyear warranty and the pair we looked at today will set you back three hundred and fifty dollars but with a 30day return policy plus ten dollars shipping its worth the risk of trying them out over famous namebrand headphones for the same price but with lesser abilities so once again this is Tony Liotta from audio ha Alex keep listening", "video_title": "AIAIAI TMA2 Wireless Headphones Review", "video_comment_count": "280", "video_dislike_count": "360", "video_view_count": "5442",

they any good well lets take a closer look dont forget to hit the red button to subscribe and give this video a thumbs up and click the notification bell to get my next video first so my friends these are the Sennheiser wireless bluetooth headphones now what makes these a little bit more special than maybe some others is the fact that the price point they come in they offer active noise cancellation now these at the moment in the UK under 150 pounds and around 199 dollars in the US I will leave the latest link in the description so that you can check out the very latest price for whenever youre watching this video what makes these headphones interesting is the fact that youre getting over ear active noise canceling for around a hundred pounds or a hundred dollars less than some of the major brands now clearly as soon as you open the box one area that youll see that theyve saved money is not only the packaging but also the case that you keep them in its very flimsy and its not really gonna offer too much in the way of protection theres plenty of instructions but the good thing is is that it doesnt seem that they skimped at all on the quality of the actual headphones first impressions are that they look and feel absolutely firstclass they look very similar to the leading brands and the build quality is almost identical is very very impressive as well as the black which I have sent hauser also do these in white and I do have to say these look the business and Ive seen videos with the white versions and I think that they definitely look better and Im a little bit gutted that Sen Hauser didnt send through those white ones for me to test anyway though these are still nicelooking and they feel really good quality as I mentioned earlier now a couple of things that youll want to know is that these do pack down really small obviously you can use the case which I showed you earlier but its fairly flimsy and so it wont offer that much protection but in terms of room for packing then these dont take up so much space at all now all of the controls are on the right ear cup so everything is there Im going to go through those in just a second because again theres a couple of nice neat little features on there now also within the box I forgot to mention that you do also get your audio cable and your USB C charging cable you will be able to charge this to full within a couple of hours and it will last for 30plus hours in fact in my test I got just over 31 hours in terms of full use when wearing headphones its important that they are comfortable and youll be pleased to hear wearing these was an absolute joy theres one little caveat that I would add and that is that the ear cups can get quite warm the headband is cushioned and again didnt feel like it was wearing on the top of the head which some headphones have done in the past but the cushioning was really good it felt very comfortable to wear however your ears do get a little bit warm in them so if you are prone to that then you may want to just consider taking these off and giving yourself some breaks now the build quality of these as I mentioned earlier they feel really robust and I think that theyll definitely survive the odd drop twist or sitting on them you can definitely give a little bit of robust twisting and it doesnt feel you dont hear any creaks any sounds of stress I wouldnt recommend you do this all the time guys but just to show you that they are fairly robust okay so Im firing up the headphones now the one first test that I want to do is testing the microphone capability because for me thats a big feature being able to take calls and being heard clearly on the other persons phone as I mentioned earlier all of the controls are on the right air cup the first button on the left hand side which is slightly awkward to get to is to summon your Google assistant or Siri to the side of this youve got the toggle for skipping forward a track and back a track its a really nice mechanism where you can push up to go forward a track down to back attract and then push in to play or pause and also this doubles as answering and rejecting calls and also putting them on hold to the side of this is the volume rocker and that is just straight forward up and down and then to the side of that is the USB charging port next along you have the port for the 25 millimeter audio cable and these sets of headphones come with a 25 millimeter to 35 millimeter cable so you can plug straight into your device whether that be a phone if it still has a port or some other device and then finally on the right hand side youve got your onoff and pairing switch and also this doubles up for active noisecancelling when you first turn the headphones on it will go straight into bluetooth pairing mode if you want to get it into pairing mode at a later date then you turn it on and keep on pressing hold now to turn on active noisecancelling you just need to press the button whilst the headphones are on now frustratingly you dont get an audio prompt to tell you that youre in anc mode obviously the most important thing about headphones is sound and Im pleased to report that the sound quality delivered by these Sennheiser headphones is absolutely exceptional it is far better than the price of pointer suggests now dont get me wrong theyre not perfect and I will come on to the failings of these headphones in just a second but if you are looking for rich sounds deliverable bass then youre definitely going to be pleased with these another nice and surprising feature with headphones at this price is that you do get an accompanying app in here you can go in and change the equalizer settings and give yourself two different tones now I havent played too much with this but its just a nice feature to have now you may well be considering on purchasing these headphones but I do think theres some other important information that you need to be aware of firstly bluetooth 50 this means that you can switch these headphones between different phones for instance because its got that more modern type of Bluetooth there are no proximity sensors on these headphones and that means that when you take the headphones off it doesnt pause the music automatically and therefore you need to be aware of that and actually port it yourself that does come with an auxiliary cable and that means that you dont have to have power you dont have to have a charged battery in order for these to work you can just plug in the power cable or the auxiliary cable and work in the same way a wide set of headphones word the ANC is limited so the active noise cancellation I found it to be probably about a six out of ten its definitely better than some of the cheaper brands that you get and some of the almost like the mock ANC but its definitely no in there as good as the leading brands so have you expecting it to you be then you might be disappointed however and I come onto this on my last point for the value its not bad the other thing that I think that you need to be aware of is if youve got a large head you may find these a little bit too tight I would say that these are for a medium sized head finally when it comes to value I definitely think that these are worth it but those extra features for this price point is really very very good somewhere friends when it comes down to take one of the biggest factors for me is value for money and I definitely think that youre getting that with these headphones the sound quality is incredibly good and very very surprising but theyre not without issues as Ive already mentioned but for the money they do represent really good value for money Ill leave my links in the description for you to check out for yourself guys let me know also theres other headphones in this price range that you would recommend and Ill see whether I can get hold of them thank you so much for watching this video and I do look

102248585880", "video_id": "ppLzRUzJc2I", "Closed Captions": " Music hey whats up guys this is Jayden for gizmo x and youre watching a full review of the shamisen me super bass wireless headphones these were recently launched at the Amazon panda sale and we had done the unboxing on the next day but we were asked by a lot of people to do the full review if you are also told by others that you havent done the filter and this is just the unboxing and thats wrong but we had to use it for a few days before coming up with the final judgement about it and these are priced at 1800 rupees these are onear headphones and they come with those flexible or the adjustable ear muffs and the bluetooth as well as the word option thats the ox option it has a battery life of for 20 hours of playback with the 400 mah battery that comes with a 40 mm dynamic driver is given here for the sound output but lets start with the design to start the review so first off with the build quality I felt its good first thing that is like this that its light in weight so its not heavy at all and the good thing is that since its not heavy you dont have to you wont ever feel uncomfortable with that but on the other side being light isnt the only thing that would make it feel comfortable its also the flexibility of this extendable arm or this on that II that goes over the head so how flexible is this is what Im showing you it is actually flexible but then these are so hard in a way that when you keep wearing it for long hours I I was in a flight for about two and half hours and then I wore it continuously in the cab as well which was about a four hours of continuous usage and I felt that yeah it was a bit painful on the ears the fact that these earmuffs are not as large compared to the ear sizes these actually sit over the ears and that is sometimes painful for most of the users for me it was painful it did you that a little bit of a discomfort but if you listen to the music for about one hour and then taking a break that wont be an issue so if you are someone whos a or audio file and keeps listening to music all the time I dont think this would be a proper fit for you you should go with something that has larger ear muffs and something that has enough size for you years to go in and sit there properly and adjust itself here its not that not the case that way because once you extend these and make the set over your head this is the area where it would to go over the ears and then press the ears so this these are quite comfortable actually this this would be not that hard but still for a longer use I felt that they were not so good so you know where they are light which is one of the good things but otherwise they are going to be discomforting for users for longer run and the second thing is I wore it and took it off for quite a lot of times already now because Ive been using these headphones extensively and no other headphones even 4G mobile for gaming for music for watching web series everything was on this for the last few days and I felt these kind of things are something that Xiaomi should have actually taken a good control or a good measure of so this this adhesive is loose use you can see that this is not even a full week of usage and this adhesive is already giving up and this foam area here is actually lifting itself off I dont know how long will this day but I can say that its a bit poorly made that way or it could be a quality control issue on this particular headset and it might be better on the other ones but you can clearly see that the odyssey of there was loose even here you can listen to the sound here that is a dress here that gets looser and whenever you try to pull it but here in this this case it was not here because these are the buttons on the right side when I weighed them and always when you lift keep it over the head this way you try to adjust it after you wear it and that is when it keeps getting loose with this adhesive and the foam is actually loose here so I dont like the make of this one in that way because it should have been made better though thats the case I feel that it should be the case only with my headphones and I feel I hope its not with every other me super miss headphones that others buy so thats it with the build quality next with the major one thats the audio quality frankly I like the audio quality the output on every kind of genre that I heard on the pop music on something that I heard classical the regular Bollywood music everyone was good the bass levels were actually pretty good and sometimes they also felt a bit too harsh I mean heavy on the bass levels what the name says super bass that is the case here its actually super busy and the base levels where you cant control them so thats one thing unless you have proper equalizing in your phone you counted is the base levels and I couldnt do that on my real me X as well as on the Redmond k20 Pro I tried it on both of them I couldnt do that so I felt that when I was playing the pubsey mobile game why is the audio sound the sounds that come out when people are walking around when this car driving or those things it was pretty perfect but when there was some shooting happening the base levels were actually like hitting the years every bullet sound that comes when you try to shoot someone the base levels are pretty high and I couldnt control it so that was one base something I I felt that its too heavy on the ears and otherwise if you are listening to the music its all perfect I felt that these were pretty fine with the audio quality the audio levels can be adjusted into as one is on the headphones and other is on the phone so if you are using these buttons here it doesnt mean that it would change the same on the phone as well so its double control you can control it here and then you can control it on the phone as well so thats a good thing actually you dont have to control it only on one side you can reduce the audio here and if you feel that its still high you can reduce that on the phone as well or if its low you can increase it on the phone so that way with the controls now well go to the connectivity next because of that control part I talked about connectivity is very good actually I tried quite a lot of Bluetooth earphones in the recent times I felt that these are the most easiest to connect to first thing is you need to just press the power button for three seconds and it would turn on the headphones and also say that its about two pair so there are two things power on and pairing is what it says and you will see that it instantly connected here so though it was already paired so thats that he said it connected but the other reason is that when I try to pair it with a newer phone that after the real makes I tried connecting this to the red mackay 20 Pro it took the same amount of time to show the headphones theyre ready for pairing and it took so it takes only a few seconds for the entire fading to complete and next part was about the battery percentage which the user manual said that it might not work with Android phones but it did work with both of them so it shows the battery level 90 here after some amount of usage so and after that you can control the phone audio the media audio and also the contact sharing these are the things that you can do with the phones connectivity on the headphones and the pairing was pretty easy and even the continuity is pretty easy about 20 feet to 25 feet is what I tried and the connectivity was seamless there was no disconnection there was no loss in connectivity anywhere and that was good I felt that with the connectivity part Xiaomi actually bet most of the other headphones because always I have an issue with Bluetooth headphones getting disconnected having issues with pairing sometimes it loses the connectivity while the music is on so that way I felt that it was not good on the other other headphones but with the Xiaomi is Super Bass wireless headphones it was pretty brilliant that way next with the wired thing so there are two options anyway as I said you have the wireless Bluetooth audio as well as the aux audio here so with the aux now lets talk about Bob tmobile if you use ox and the wired option its going to be as good as any other regular headphones and its going to work perfectly with Bluetooth there is little isnt latency but compared to the other headphones I find that this has lesser latency and the millisecond gap that you see whenever you try to play it on the phone with Bluetooth and when you are playing the game that is an important thing the latency on Bluetooth whenever you try to play games with the Bluetooth headphones if someone shooting at you and you realize that it was already a short and then you heard it on the headphones theres not a lot of gap here but I would always used suggest to use the wire rather than the Bluetooth option unless you have a phone that doesnt have the 35 mm headset jack in that case you might have to buy an adapter one thing I could attest is that whether it will work with the 35 mm to type C adapter but on the regular phones which has the headset jack it did work pretty well and the last thing now before we ended two things actually battery and the noise cancellation so nice cancellation is something that people had asked me about whether these earphones headphones have noise cancellation they dont have it on paper so you wont see any noise cancellation but when I was in the flight the engine noise always is loud you that and when I wore these headphones and played some music that has quite a lot of bass levels I felt that there was quite a lot of noise that get muffled and the external noise was not that much audible people around me that were talking I couldnt hear them properly only because of the fact that these are quite tight and in that way theres no active or passive noise cancellation done by the headphones but these earmuffs pretty tightly and snug on the ears in that way the external noise was not that much audible but there is no actual noise cancellation being done by this means super bass wireless headphones and the last one was about the battery life so battery life is claimed to be about 20 hours of playback time I played it continuously for about 10 to 12 months and the battery left was about 40 38 or somewhere around that is what I last saw so its almost as good as it was claimed to be about 20 hours and it has bluetooth 50 and also the last thing there was some question about the connectivity with the PC some said that it isnt working with the Mac Macs audio output thats the headphone jack it actually works pretty well if you are using the Ox cable given in the Box packaged and connected with a Mac it actually works pretty well there is no issue at all that way so this was the full review of the me Super Bass wireless headphones I think I might have missed a few points if you still have any other questions you want me to check something about these headphones to let me know in the comments Ill try to answer them and Ill do actually check before I answer and Ill try to give my entire thought about it for that particular question so I hope you liked this video I hope I answered most of the questions that you guys had about these headphones and yeah what the competition as well there were a couple of headphones that people wanted to compare me with this and those were the sony MDR XB 450 also there was the board rockers fight and I frankly dont have both of them I am going to order them and Ill try to compare all the three so that you get a clearer understanding of which one has a better audio output though the board walkers has all the lesser battery life of 10 ours is what the company has claimed and there is 54 driver on the and this 50 mm driver on this one is one a while compared to the 40 mm one on this one so I feel there should be quite a lot of difference all the three so Ill try to compare them frankly I havent used them so I wont give my judgment about those two compared to this one so this was the full review of the me super baseball has headphones I hope you liked this video if you do do share and subscribe to this one I in some mode thank you for watching and see ya next video Music",

check out the ax low e 50 Bluetooth earbuds this was sent to me and figured I would do an unboxing and I first look at some of the features here lets go ahead and get all of the components out of the box alright what do we have here weve got a small storage bag we have a USB charging cable different size rubber earpieces this is looks like a typical overview and instruction booklets I have the earbuds themselves which we will dive into a little deeper here in just a moment left and right of course last thing in the Box is the storage and charging station there we go alright lets jump a little bit into these one on one okay first of all the storage bag nothing fancy just has a couple of cinch cords and and thats it pretty basic next we have the earbud size adapters here so it actually comes with four different sets and it has just small medium and large and then the piece on the earbud is already attached it looks like it may be a medium size already on there so those are pretty standard charging cable also fairly standard its just a regular USB on one side and then your USB micro on the other for the charging and storage station lets go ahead look around USB here on the front or USB micro on the side which is what youll be using to charge this and thats all the exterior connections open it up and thats where you will be charging and storing your earbuds and so for the earbuds themselves of course you get two of them it has a light indicator here on the front and this is actually a button you can use to adjust the settings so and you can see you on this side you have your charging ports there lets go ahead and stick these on the charger so this is right and this is left it is magnetic so it will stay in there if you tip it up like that pretty cool and you can see the lights inside of the case there now lets go ahead and make a connection here Ive got bluetooth turned on my phone and you can connect these to a pair to the phone or one to a phone or one to a phone one to something else if you want so lets go ahead and tap Settings here Im going to pull one of these out turns it on go to connections and Bluetooth and were going to find the attitude R which means attitude of the right side go ahead and tap that says it is pairing connected alright lets go ahead and find something to play here Ive got some copyright free music so Im just playing what youre hearing through this earbud just to show that it is working so you noticed I just tapped the outside here and see how it stopped here tap again and now its playing again so Im going to tap on the earbud pause play so Im gonna go back into the Bluetooth settings Im going to go into the settings of the hit earbud and delete that one and now Im going to set it back on the charger basically turns it off and now Im going to pull both of these out and then Im going to do a scan for my Bluetooth Im going to select attitude this time its supposed to pair both of them alright shouldnt speared now lets go back into our music all right theyre both playing so lets go ahead and put this up to that mic Music there you go so that one will pause and that one will unpause so the button seems to doing the same feature there here are some of the specifications of these earbuds it works bluetooth version 50 has a waterproof level of an IP x5 it works noise cancellation is a CVC 6 and I can actually tell quite a muffled sound from my own voice so it is cancelling out pretty good operating range 10 meters which is 33 feet thats pretty typical Bluetooth range there lets see the working time is three hours charging time is one hour and a charging time of the case is three to four hours these earbuds fit in my ear very well with the medium size rubber piece I like being able to just tap on them to pause or play my device also you can do the same with a phone call so just tap that and it will answer your phone call for you pretty cool feature and I think they will stay in my ear well enough whenever doing running or any other kind of intense outdoor activity so definitely check these out I have a link to them in the description down below thanks for watching and I will see

wireless active noise cancelling headphones you could buy today were reviewing the much anticipated successor the sony wh000xm4 priced at under 30 000 rupees does the sony wh000xm4 live up to those expectations lets find out in our review but before we get started dont forget to subscribe and also hit the bell icon to be notified every time we post a new video the sony wh1000xm4 headphones look almost identical to the xm3 but with small design differences in the size weight and the headband this is a good thing as the headphones feel good and are very comfortable even over long periods i quite like the velvety texture of the swipe controls and the simplicity of the buttons and ports some interesting features include the proximity sensor that automatically plays and pauses the music when the headphones are put on or taken off quick attention mode to be able to hear your surroundings and a new one that i found very useful speak to chat with this active the headphones automatically pause the music and activate hear through mode when your voice is detected this happens automatically and worked quite well in my experience with the sony wh000xm4 the sony headphones connect app is as useful as always allowing you to customize and control various aspects of the sony wh000xm4 this includes the intensity of the noise cancellation and your through modes the equalizer the function of the custom button and more as well as monitoring the codec in use and the battery level of the headset the sony wh000xm4 features 40 mm dynamic drivers bluetooth 5 for connectivity support for the sbc aac and ldac bluetooth codecs and optional wired connectivity through the included stereo cable Music theres no support for the qualcomm aptx bluetooth codec which might affect sound quality a little bit with source devices that dont support the ldac codec under the hood is the sony qn1 active noise cancelling processor this is the same as the one used on the sony wh000xm3 but sony claims to have improved the algorithm to get better and more accurate active noise cancellation battery life is impressive as well the sony wh000xm3 ran for around 28 hours on a full charge with active noise cancellation running much of the time charging is through the usb typec port and theres also support for fast charging when it comes to sound quality the sony wh000xm4 offers an excellent listening experience with topnotch active noise cancellation the active noise cancellation is indeed slightly improved on the wh1000xm4 although the sony wh000xm4 just about matches up to the bose noise cancelling headphone 700 when it comes to active noise cancellation the sound is lively detailed engaging and just about the most enjoyable i have heard on a good pair of wireless active noise cancelling headphones although not quite as analytical as the shaw aeonic 50 the sony wh000xm4 offers a more flexible and adaptable sonic signature that seems to adjust itself on the fly depending on the genre of music lively tracks sounded exciting laid back tracks sounded more detailed and the headphones generally ensured a fun listening experience with a superb sound stage as with most highend headphones the sony wh000xm4 sounded absolutely fantastic with high resolution music particularly tidal masters and dolby atmos audio tracks however there wasnt a significant reduction in performance even with regular compressed audio tracks with the sony headphones offering the same immersive and engaging sound with only a slight drop in the level of detail if youre in the market for a new pair of wireless noise cancelling headphones you really cant do any better than the sony wh000xm4 right now although not as detailed and analytical as the shaw aeonic 50 the sony wh000xm4 adds some much needed flavor to the sound making for a much more engaging and much more fun sound that was our review of the sony wh000xm4 for more such videos and to check out our full review dont forget to log on

youtube fam how yall doing tm nation how yall doing its your boy tecmo here again back with another review on unboxing and today is a special day you guys know when the crushers drop and they come in everything stops and yall that have been watching me for a while know that i pretty much own all of the crusher headphones except for the older models that were wired and used batteries believe it or not i did own a pair of the original skull crushers back in the day and since i purchased that pair of headphones years ago i never found another headphone company that could deliver that subwoofer base so needless to say over the years i have amassed a small crusher collection as you can see right here here are my crusher wireless headphones still working no issues here we have my crusher 360s still working without a problem i love these headphones and the newest pair besides the crusher evos these other crusher ancs still sound amazing no problems and now i have the newest pair the crusher evos and man so far these live up to the crusher name but that brings me to my next point which is that i know not everybody wants to spend 200 or more for a good pair of bass headphones of course in this video im gonna mainly focus on the evos as they are the newest out of the bunch however the crusher wireless headphones and the crusher 360s may be viable options for you as theyre always on sale you can usually find these for about a hundred dollars and these for about 150 and to make it even more interesting the crusher ancs now cost the same price as the crusher evos so i say all of that to say this it can be a little bit difficult to choose a pair of crushers if price to performance is your concern so in this video im going to try to help you guys out a little bit of course like i said im gonna focus on the evos but towards the end of the video i will do a little comparison so you know how each pair of headphones stacks up for now focusing on the crusher evos they retail for 199 and you have some pretty impressive features at that price youll get about 40 hours of battery life with these on a single charge to personalize your sound feature through the app you have usb type c for charging and you have builtin mics for voice calls ill go over more of the specs with the evos and do all of my normal tests a little later on in the video but so that you know what youll get if you decide to pick a pair up let me unbox them for you alright so taking a look at the box you get nice presentation with the evos and thats nothing new the last few pairs of crushers that ive picked up really had premium packaging and when you get them you feel like youre unboxing something special once you open up the box youll see that you have information about the crusher evos on the inside flap and then on the other side you have some quick start instructions to get you up and running moving right along inside of the box you get pretty much everything you would need to put you on your path to deafness this includes your user manual and warranty documentation a usb typec cable to charge the headphones you get a 35 millimeter cable if you want to use them in wired mode and a nice carrying bag with the headphones inside i must say that although the back is not going to provide a lot of protection i like the design the inside of the bag is really soft and its made out of like a sheepskin filling material which gives the bag a really nice touch now taking a look at the crusher evos the design is really nice in my opinion they do look pretty similar to the crusher anc headphones but they do have some differences which ill touch on a little bit later as you can see i did pick up the black pair just to keep everything uniform but you do have the chill gray color as well i do own the indie fuels in the chill gray color and i must say that the color does grow on you over time the overall construction of the crusher evos feels sturdy in the hands out of the box i dont hear any creaks or anything of that nature and they are relatively flexible with the design of the crusher evos you can also lay them completely flat on a surface or fold them up if you want to most headphones only give you one or the other but if those are concerns for you they got you covered for battery life with the evos just to recap youll get about 40 hours on a single charge i just got them so i cant tell you just how accurate that number is but judging from my other crusher headphones they usually get pretty close to that advertised number these also do feature quick charging though so only 10 minutes worth of charging will get you about 3 hours worth of use theyre also using bluetooth 50 so pairing them to any bluetooth device is simple and only takes a moment all that you have to do is hold down the orange power button and that will put them into pairing mode from there simply find the crusher evos on your device connect to them and youre good to go the connection in terms of walking distance for me has been pretty good i can usually walk about 60 or so feet away from my device before i start getting some crackling and then anything beyond that is usually when they disconnect in terms of latency i havent experienced any type of lag watching youtube videos or movies on my iphone 11 or my galaxy s20 i have watched media on both devices and everything seemed to be pretty synced up the crusher evos do have builtin mics so you can take voice calls directly from the headphones ive made a few voice calls using them and i think that the call quality is respectable but so that you guys can judge for yourselves lets take a listen all right guys so right now i have the crusher evos paired to my iphone 11 im not going to do any type of editing to this audio so this should give you a pretty good idea of how youll sound using these for boys calls for playback controls the crusher evos have three physical buttons on the right ear cup and you do have all of your playback controls with these which is nice you can control your volume your tracks and your calls to control the intensity of your base you simply use the slider on the left ear cup and its buttery smooth you can slide it up and down pretty easily so you shouldnt have any issues dialing the base in the way that you want it now moving on to the way that the crusher evos fit on my head i have no complaints in terms of the comfort they have generous amounts of padding on the ear cups and for those of you that are bald like myself the padding on the top is sufficient earlier i did wear them for about an hour straight and i didnt have any ear fatigue or discomfort now if youre worried about sound leakage these are probably not the right headphones for you because they do leak a lot of sound but just so you guys have an idea of how much sound they leak when turned all the way up lets take a listen as i mentioned earlier you can change the sound with the crusher evos through the skullcandy app through the app you can choose from three different eq modes which are movie music and podcasts or if you want to use the personalized feature you can use this to optimize the sound based on your hearing when you go through this process the headphones will play different sounds and you tell the app which frequencies that your ears hear the process does take a minute or so to complete but once its done your sound profile will be stored the crusher evos are also compatible with the tile app which is a nice feature if you ever cant remember where you put your headphones when youre using this feature and you get closer to the headphones the app will let you know and the volume of the chime will go down for me personally this feature is more helpful with earbuds but it doesnt hurt to have that feature with the headphones as well alright guys so now that you have an idea of what the crusher evos have to offer lets get into a little bit of a comparison and before i get into it let me just say this and cover this base i dont care which pair you pick up nobody does bass headphones like skull candy i have had a couple pair of the sony extra bass headphones and before you ask me now panasonic is also getting into the base game now i did try out their bass headphones and i wasnt impressed so first lets start with the oldest pair out of the bunch the crusher wireless headphones and these are not quite as refined as the others with these you will hear some creaks here and there even when theyre brand new out of the box and one thing that i want to note for you guys is this is the only pair out of the bunch that has exposed speaker wires the overall sound signature with the crusher wireless headphones is dedicated to the bass although you will get some decent mids and highs at lower volumes they fall off quickly when you crank them up the bass is also very impressive at about 50 to 75 percent but as you crank them up it does get weaker even with all of that being said trust me the base that these provide is much more than you need the battery life with these is good at about 40 hours but remember they are older so youre going to get some older tech with the crusher wireless headphones youre going to get bluetooth 40 and they charge via micro usb if those are deal breakers for you keep that in mind but price wise you can usually find these for about a hundred bucks next in line are the crusher 360s and these are step up from the crusher wireless out of all four pair i like the design of these the most and a couple things set these apart from the pack first your base slider on the 360s is not a physical slider but you control it using your finger as youre going through the levels there are led lights on the side of the headphones that change based on the intensity this may not be a big deal to you but for me the design is nice for me the led lights add a nice little touch thats a little bit cooler than just having a normal slider the crusher 360s are a little bit newer so youre going to get bluetooth 41 they still charge using micro usb and the battery is decreased at 29 hours another feature that i like about the design of the 360s is you can see the battery life left on your headphones directly from the headphones you can see the battery left on the headphones at any time by simply pressing the button on the left ear cup for sound the 360s are going to be cleaner in terms of highs and mints than the crusher wireless headphones for the base youre also not going to get as big of a drop off when you crank them up price wise these are still a good value you can usually find them for about 150 bucks next we have the crusher anc headphones and this is the only pair out of the bunch that offers active noise cancelling the design with the ancs is different from the 360s and the crusher wireless headphones these have more rounded edges instead of the boxier look that youll get with those older headphones the ancs are also newer so with them youll get bluetooth 50 usb typec for charging and like i said these are going to give you active noise canceling but it does come at the cost of battery life as these offer you about 24 hours sound wise the crusher ancs are a step up from the crusher 360s especially with the clarity the base is a little bit deeper and a little bit more punchy and it is going to maintain its strength at higher levels but base wise there is not a world of difference in between the 360s and the ancs the clarity is the big difference with the crusher ancs the highs and mids are more pronounced and they stay relatively clear when you max them out although most people will never feel the need to max these out you will get some distortion when you crank them up and as for the active noise cancelling it does work well with these but to be honest you really dont need it anytime that you have these headphones up 50 or more youre really not gonna hear whats going on around you price wise like i said earlier the crusher ancs now cost the same price as the crusher evos at 199 and now we arrive at the crusher evos and guys im gonna keep it as short and sweet as possible these are amazing for me these provide the best listening experience out of all of my crusher headphones the highs and mids are impressive and you dont get a big drop off even when you crank them all the way up also i am pleased with the amount of bass that you retain even when you max the bass slider out so far out of the three modes i pretty much leave these on movies mode the music mode is nice as well but for me the movies mode is where you get the most balance the sound profile that the app created for me doesnt sound that great so at this point i pretty much leave it off and i want to make it clear these headphones are not just about head rattling bass if you dont want that much bass and you just want to chill and relax simply push the slider down a little bit and youll be all set you do not get a tiny or airy sound with these headphones so im saying just try them out i think youll be impressed so that being said guys i hope this helps you pick your pair of crusher headphones like i said earlier if bass is your thing you wont go wrong with either pair but for right now the evos are my favorite but thats it for this video guys if you have any questions as always leave them in the comment section ill try to get you an answer thank you guys for coming through and hanging out with me the support really does mean a lot until next time yall be safe yall stay positive and most

technology atech today because I have the micro here in my hand wireless gear bones light and this is the global version of these headphones xiao wireless come to me it is also known as good Chinese version It is known as air two projects for two principles it gives me each name each new device is already a cell phone or headphones well in this case well this is the global version as I tell you my true wireless air bones light Sorry its for the English but hey here we have it well without more to say then Im going to unbox the unboxing while Im mentioning you I got these wireless headphones for  29 In the express platform 29 dollars is only the cost of those sold hearing aids but also in this case you have to take into account what is the shipping cost against glued is very sealed I already am taking out and here I have it to see to see one year later two years later at last I already have it better here and I start open to see what it contains and before removing the hearing aids from the box then we go for that part of where that says the tribe characteristics wireless stereo well as the global version told you not here we have to it was in english and it says authentic wireless stereo sound yes too has call noise cancellation has good supports fast charging and says fabes quick connection connection as it comes with a button on the charging base that says touch control touch control ok now Im going to proceed to remove and we have around here go go I see it really flawless fine so far so I can see they are perfect now and follow what the little arrow says then remove this from this part and lets see lets hold The headphones or I dont have it around here I leave it here and the other here too now Im going to remove what is the base the charging box and remove its respective plastic force here we can see the xiao logo ming that comes in the box box plastic yes now the camera does not focus now yes wow aesthetically I see it perfect I love it if it looks like to apple spots but here we have it in the version good in itself to me If I am going to check if I have nothing else in here in this part of the box and then this does include what is charging cable since the air dots and the Well priests do not include it well I will leave you the link of the video of the boxing of the airbags that or better known with the name of the version global micro wireless dear boots basic yes well Ill leave you here the link will be appearing up here we have here the cable there is nothing else I will remove this but here we have the manual if I do not Im wrong because we dont know that it came out in nobody so we threw it here here we have more pads of different sizes I dont know if we can appreciate well Yes now Im going to open well Im going to break to be able to show you and to know how many countries the camera is focusing on to see if and from what it seems we have in different sizes two to three additional pairs for not breaking the whole bag as friends said these headphones well wireless those wireless headphones got it for 29 dollars only the price that the hearing aids have been without taking into account and not even without shipping since good for the according to the time varies the shipping but to me when I bought it together with the airbags good with the micro wireless starbuks basic s since it has been purchased or the hearing aids shipping I like 41 dollars as you know on each platform the shipping cost It changes according to the time not the date you buy it but that is the price of these headphones 29 dollars if here in peru lima peru they sell these same if If they are original I have seen in an importing gallery that they sell it 280 soles and if I remember correctly online I saw it at 260 soles yes well it depends on each one where to buy it where to buy it but as I say and recommend always buy original products well here we have good two pads silicone we have two other two so we have three pairs one two three although it can serve as a spare in in case this gets lost I know there are some and they dont stain well here we have spare well this Im going to put it aside and you can the charging cable from type the camera focuses input type c if it is very long lets say plastic removal here we are talking about about 40 centimeters 40 centimeters of cable well the good thing is that charging cable cable is included because we have headphones yes the truth is that I see it and I love them personally they are very beautiful the truth aesthetically all the finish well I see it well I love how I repeat them again for this part we have what are the charging pins and really for its price I will focus again as I tell you if it is worth it Well it depends on you I buy it here locally or if it is import or also the price of those audios not according to your country well Im going to mention the functions since as I said here in the part in this part some of its characteristics Music says call noise cancellation to activate noise cancellation while listening to music or being in a call because the right earphone is fine we keep it pressed for about 23 seconds and it will activate what is noise cancellation if you also have another double tap function double tap to be able to pause or play when we are listening to music ok and will not answer yes is that we only give it a touch this good this option I imagine what I put because if we are accommodating the headphones in the ear well coincidentally we will have to load and not be stopping the music I imagine that if what he has done is not put any option do nothing if there is a touch and on the left side well in this hearing aid on the left if we also hold down Well we will automatically pull the noise cancellation and if we give two touch because we will activate google so agree can now be a small test connecting it to the a3 I have around here to see how much it is there it sounds like this without mentioning them before because here we have the charging base not well I see her well I really see her very pretty perfect all the riding has completely finished polished and as I was saying then if there is some kind of mishap or inconvenience in some of my videos as I said sometime you the followers because all the video then practically run are rare the times he edited the video and in order to make a more fluid video with ideas and not have a script to follow good to my comfort i like to make videos this way I hope you like it and you can value the effort because we have the input type I know well that we have seen although it comes with the type d cable and these buttons well this button that we see here is to synchronize with the device in this case like this one I have 3 the second Im going to pair the device with the headphones Im going to press the button I have the gross activated on the phone to see if it is that syncs Im already pressing there we can see that a small light has been lit if we are walking true and here the phone was looking for one lets see lets see if it can detect but again Im going to press so as not to be long the video I am going to pass it to a second and resumed when I have friends well linked at last after many Attempts to try to connect you can know the moment as I could count them the headphones were inserted here in the box and each I took out the other one I tried to link them they did not appear on the device I do not see no I recognized myself and you can recommend it well based on my experience that has happened to me now always take out the first what is the right handset and then the left and it was just like that when he appeared on my cell phone now I have it connected here we can see my tw yesterday pons light active 70 of battery and now Im going to stop playing music so you can see how loud its volume is and well look we are experiencing a small error that when I have it out of the ears because it does not reproduce nor do we make that later the sensors do not it is handled here but well already with use and I have not already used it because for something is unboxing yes and really for the few minutes that I have had the sound quality that is good is really worth it for the price as I say well and well this loaded base as we can see without the headphones if we leave it like that because they are pulled back in this case with the headphones inside if they stand up ok then and well friends the video is getting very long again and I hope I have tried to cover all the possible characteristics and recommendations that It may interest you I hope you really like it and in conclusion I I recommend these micro wireless earbuds the bronx line well friends I hope you really like

they did not even cut off so for a cheap set of headphones the range is actually the best ive had um high definition sound thats true um let me tell you something about the sound though the sound the volume dont go that loud but it does sound very good on lightweight collapsible easy storage uh kind of flimsy in the hand but on the head it feels pretty good on the basics the specs yall can read that if you want i dont care whats in the box one pair of wireless onear headphones um 135 millimeter aux cable um 39 foot um a micro usb charging cable i dont think it has the um the plugin piece but it has the cable thats all i need you know i said i got so many plugins and so many devices that dont need a plugin piece um quick start guide pretty good headphones for about 15 bucks all right yall its 2 39 um i was listening to that mp rebel um petey crack um im driving right now im late im supposed to be at the gym right now so i didnt have enough time to like sit here but its just a time and a bit of a i literally just got out of bed i didnt even brush my teeth but im driving already um yeah gotta hit the gym its called dedication all right i got time im trying to make it so i have time to get when i get home before i go to work um to be able to take a shower freshman to do all that before i get to work maybe even have a snack i dont know if not ima just have a longer fast during the boat we can explain that later thats another video but were gonna go to the gym and im gonna tell you how these headphones sound and feel all right yall like i said right now its like 2 40 2 am i go to the town i go to this gym at this time a little early im like 40 minutes late i woke up a little late but uh i go to the gym at this time to avoid people um i said that my last video for people that have been around they know this already about me but im only saying this for people that you know brand new or need maybe maybe this is bad advice for some people you know im saying it is kind of dangerous to go out at this time you know just getting out from your car and getting it to the gym youre sitting duck youre saying be ready you know what im saying watch your back you know this aint for everybody i wouldnt recommend this for everybody you know im saying if youre not ready then dont do it you know what im saying but um thats not what this video is about um but thats not even why i cut my camera back on we almost there um a couple lights down and were gonna hit the left well be there and uh what im saying is a lot of im just hoping that theres nobody there yesterday when i got there it was a couple of cars one duel um theres always that one dude it could be one dude in the gym and itll be that one dude not particularly that guy but its always that guy you know what im saying but uh what do they do they um how about i know i didnt pass it okay so where i go every day i get sidetracked by yall but yeah um if youre trying to be above average thats what let me cut to chase youre trying to be above average you cannot be cool with going in the gym and not having good workouts every time yes youre gonna have some bad workouts but you cant be it cant be half of your workouts it cant be most of your workouts cant be none of that thats bad you know what im saying if you go to the gym people mess you up you you go in there you keep on going in there and not doing what you got to do yes you can kind of grow you can kind of blame yourself if you do that but at the same time yes and no people that aint never been under that bar they dont know and people that have been under that bar but not as intensely oh yeah i see one truck one truck one pickup truck yeah man this is this is this is what im talking about one truck and i dont see the dual car i know exactly who it was the other day i dont see his car oh cool no literally people are in your way when youre lifting heavy weights the heavy weights are dangerous all right heavy weights are dangerous i dont care what nobody say thats what my morning face looks like um go ahead and grab my bag go ahead and grab my bag i got my sugary drink its a great family with some uh ocean spray cranberry pomegranate in it leave that up there real quick yall go probably see my messy car as i get my bag same thing like yesterday for people that have seen it aint gonna show yall too much but ill get my bag real quick but i always say this and i said it yesterday and im gonna say it today if your car and your house is totally sparkling clean either youre not busy or you dont already made it or you got made to something i guess you already made it lets go in the gym real quick all right yall heres what the headphones look like um first hand hold it kind of feels flimsy um it looks good i like the neon blue um i like the look of these headphones but youre getting what you paid for um the buttons are so close together though the power button is in the middle i kind of dont like the button layout but at the end of the day and by the way i need to cut my nails like i said my last video im starting to look like cardi b i dont cut my nails i just let them break i dont know why i always done that i keep them clean you know what im saying but uh heres your uh usb port and your aux core port whether you want to use the aux or you know what im saying or the bluetooth um heres what the top looks like i need to take that tape off i guess theyre trying to protect the heres what it looks like with the tape off its kind of grainy i like that feel kind of a quality feel for 14 15 cut my nails man what the heck uh okay we gonna bench press im gonna see how they feel on my head as im working out im still kind of warming up i didnt get every set because the video isnt about my workout its about my look at my arms its about the headphones okay im kind of awkwardly putting my head to see if they slip and i wouldnt recommend doing that um im just showing yall especially with heavier weight this is a heavy weight to me as you see its going up and down like butter um i can bench the heaviest dumbbells in this gym which is 125 um 125s might not sound a lot but you gotta think is in each hand and then dumbbells are way harder than barbell okay this is what they look like on my head by the way im using my galaxy s20 ultra phone um i kind of dont like that space in between my head but its kind of cool i dont i dont know which i shake my head to see if theyll flop around nope holding onto my head pretty good yeah this is my morning face by the way i didnt say i didnt um comb my beard im not shaving no no i didnt call my beard but its better than 99 of yall out there thats looking yeah this is my wakeup beer this is what my beard looks like when i wake up out of bed okay yeah thats my mean face im rocking that music you know what im saying what was i listening to i think i was in bbc or something um okay i just did the 80 pound dumbbells theyre over there um i didnt film it because it wasnt worth filming i want to film something heavier so im gonna go ahead i want to get to this rack over here the 105s to the 125s thats the heaviest dumbbells we have in the gym i dont recommend that for beginners dont do it just because you see me doing it you know im saying ive been in the gym for seven years im a natural but ive been in the gym for seven years but id be cool if i only get to the 95s or 100s um heres the light dumbbells over here if you lift these tens over here leave the people that is lifting over there alone all right please you know it takes way more focus okay we gonna go with these 90s i kind of want to go with the 85s uh i dont know man up man let me go and put these 80s back and im gonna grab these 90s you know what im saying man up im gonna go ahead and do flat bench i did all my inclines okay that right there you need to focus because if you drop one of these on your toes right there im wiping the sweat off my hands um if you drop one of these on your toes or if you drop these on your face um youre gonna have a bad time man i dropped a ten pound plate on my foot one time ten pounds and my foot was so swollen it felt like a hammer hit my foot but you roll your shoulders back retracted scalpel kick back bam nineties i dont know why that first uh rep looks ugly but they like butter man like butter its aint nothing i dont know um my sugary drinks and my eating habits lately its kind of giving me a gut so i kind of probably need to um slow down i dont want to bulk up too fast but i did a couple reps i didnt do a lot of reps why because i want to go up and wait this is the difference okay these are their 90s and those are i think thats a 15 or is that a 10 thats a 15 um pound dumbbell this is the difference a lot of people look too different the heaviness the solidness the size this right here and this right here are two different weights thats not the heaviest dumbbell in the gym thats not the lightest but look at this i can grab this i can do it like that i can throw it i can actually throw it if i want to those 90s im not doing that with those thats a whole different animal right you know what im saying im just speaking to the beginners and by the time you get to these heavier weights you want to do really good form this this is how you pick up a heavy weight yeah you use your whole body its a compound movement just putting the dumbbell back over there now i should not be dropping them on the floor by the way a lot of people do it and they pick and choose who they want to pick on if i break them i pay for them you know what im saying but um yeah so here are the 100s i think cause these are hundreds of 105s i think these are the oh this is the scene i want to point out im taking a very long time to even get started i made a mistake of see how i screwed up a little bit i only scooted up a little bit i needed to scoot it up a lot more but somebody had caught my attention trying to wave at me and talk to me and this is what i mean for people that dont understand what id be saying like yo leave people alone in the gym look im thinking everything is okay everything was okay until i laid down see how my head is off the bench i am not benching like that especially with heavy weight that is bad for and you can get injured by doing that a lot of people dont bench because they torque their rotator cuffs awkwardness leads to injury awkwardness plus heavy weights equals injury all right so im like nah man and like i regroup i thought about it im like yeah im going back in um put my listen to some music okay the 105s thats what i was lifting some old guy just kept on bothering me so you know im like yeah get my game face back on this is real good music go back in look at this this is how it looks to put these weights back see how heavy that is you got to really have a technique just to put your weights back when youre lifting heavy unless you weigh about 400 pounds mass moves mass i weigh it might look like i weigh a little more because im full right now but i weigh only like 1 79 180 give or take right now um yeah these are heavy here to here is very heavy its different you know people are you crying no i aint crying im a man up and im gonna lift the same weights matter of fact im going heavier these right here are the hundreds and tens i made sure i consciously made sure i scooted all the way up so when i laid back my head is going to be on the bench right look at this the headphones by the way are holding up good the bluetooth the range of these headphones i meant to get a scene of that too but my track of thought was all the way off i meant to get a scene of me uh how far the gym is i walked all the way to the bathroom the locker room the 110s that wasnt a fail a fail is when you cant do it i decided not to do it this is voiced over i muted everything out dude was on the side of me you cant see him hes on the other side of my camera holding the conversation with me while i got on headphones and with heavy weight in my hand yall dont get it man im telling you man yall do not get it so im thinking like man should i just go down and try those or should i go im definitely not going up these are the 125s this is the heaviest dumbbells we got in the gym right the headphones did very good by the way i just wanted to show that this hair this is a headphone video man um but its still disappointing i still got some good reps and stuff i didnt show every set i was trying to show the dude he had left all right yall thats all said and done um under the circumstances i did get a good workout in im still mad i just didnt get my heavy sets that i wanted which really dont matter you know im saying i just want to prove to myself that im not even prove to myself because theres a difference between building your strength and testing your strength im trying to build my strength to build your strength you do have to go heavy you know what im saying testing your strength thats when youre maxing thats when you lift in as much as you possibly can if i was testing my strength i would have lifted that weight regardless but real lifters we dont test our strength often you know what im saying we dont max off you might see me doing singles or doubles or triples low reps higher weight but at the same time thats not a max but uh building your strength thats different you know what im saying like the singles doubles triples maxing is when you lifting the ultimate amount of weight that you can lift for either one wrap or multiple reps but the ultimate amount of reps so you cant hit another rep thats maxing you know thats two different ways of maxing theres a difference um let me show you guys something man got my song rooftop i dont know if yall can see that digging in the scene with the gangster lean but theres a difference between lifting heavy and maxing um im not gonna go too heavy if i dont feel like i should starting my joining up with the keyboard man it looks so dirty i got to clean my car i just want to show yall what time it is real quick okay copyright but its uh almost 4 30 i got to hurry up and get home um im gonna try to have time to eat real quick lets put yall up here real quick while ill talk to yall im gonna probably i would face towards me but then i would have to turn the camera on i had to turn the light on and its two three oclock its still dark out i dont want the light on in my car while im driving down the street thats a clean easy way to get pulled over and with everything going on you know what im saying i dont know everybody um but you might run into the wrong one you know im saying that i dont want that i got everything licensed registration i comply or whatever but that be the ones that end up happening too so at the end of the day you can say what you want believe what you want the proof is in there you know what im saying but uh yeah um you got too many grown people with the spike and type mentality grown man it was two grown men way above my age in the gym you know im saying way above my age you should learn about it and get away from people a lot of people be like oh well they might be just trying to you know or theyre lonely or it dont matter at the end of the day when you see somebody doing something that could potentially injure if you drop that hundred pound dumbbell on your face im actually if you drop that hundred pound dumbbell on your face what do you think is going to happen and a lot of people will say well you shouldnt lift those yes i should yes i clearly should because i want to miss you if youre not on a mission if if this isnt your lifting weights is your thing youre not i dont expect you to understand but the easiest way to understand if its not your thing is think about something that is your thing what if you like makeup you know what im saying you know what im saying you like makeup if you like makeup dude what if i just came to your house and tore up all your makeup or if you like music if you do music you got you spent all your money on a studio and every time you go in there and try to rap or sing or whatever i go in there and i just be in your way or i tear up your studio like yeah thats literally what you trying to do to me you know im saying when you you come up to me when im in the gym and you stop at me or they dont even man dog two two things that gets them the most is when i put my camera down ready to record they try to you know catch my attention or when i go heavier when i was lifting them warm up reps that yall see me doing they didnt bother me they even look my way you know what im saying like you got to calm yourself down i understand certain things might be exciting to you but you gotta come as a grown man you gotta calm yourself down you know what im saying and if you if youre so inspired if youre so i only know the words right now but if my camera is whats making you act like that you gotta remember like dawg this is 2020 the 99 of us got camera on our phones but 99 of us got smartphones you could do the same thing im doing put your camera down to make a video about what youre doing you know what im saying every video turns into a rant at the end i cant help it though man i dont have to put this at the end but you know what though man comment like subscribe share holler

Captions": " Music hey there my name is sam and welcome back to my channel so in todays video im going to be doing a uh a review of the skullcandy cess um truly wireless headphones now this is more of a oneyear later review as these are um 2019 headphones and they came out um i think april of 2019 i do believe ill correct myself on the screen right there or there anywhere on the screen now if you are a returning subscriber you youve probably noticed that the setup is different and it is um you can see theres a little bit of shadows in the lighting thats because one of my lights that i was using just happened to you know not want to work anymore so i guess were just gonna have to deal with the shadow but hopefully in the next few videos um that will be fixed and there wont be a shadow actually this light might help hold on i hope it did absolutely nothing but its done so actually hold on anyway lets get into the video now i have the headphones right here now you can see like just by looking at it uh its a pretty bulky case its um its about as um about as thick as the airpods box and nearly as thick as the galaxy buds box so theyre not theyre not like theyre not um the what do you call it skinny type of headphones um they are they are a more premium feeling type of plastic although these were 75 headphones theyre not like the most expensive but theyre a little bit more expensive than raycons but at the time raycons werent out when these came out so thats why i got them and i continued to use these um i had to send these in for repair and ive never got havent gotten them back same with these both of them are in repair and ive dropped these and havent havent had the cinnamon repair only seen some minor issues which were going to talk about so you may have noticed that there is tape right here um that tape is there because there is a crack right here and the hinge is broken but i dont blame skull candy for this because um im very hard on them and this actually fell from a balcony um a onestory balcony onto concrete below so um and for it to only sustain one crack right here um and it wasnt even where the hinge was the hinge broke because of the force but it works perfectly fine you can see its the book actually cant see that at all yeah ive got to get ive got to fix this light lighting issue but actually thats a little better but you can see right there its a little broken but it does they do continue to work obviously i dont really need the top for it because i dont really carry them around with me anymore because i have um i use wired headphones i use the um samsung akg ones because i dont feel like buying new ones right now but anyway the case is held up pretty well other than that minor drop one other thing is battery life is still pretty good battery life advertised was about four hours and its id say it lasts about three now as after using it for a while and batteries deplete after a little bit so its expected normal wear and tear but you could still buy these new now as of sound quality um i uh i dont know i cant really tell a difference between them and the galaxy but theres a minor difference um the air pods sound slightly better um the airpods have less bass these have more bass um the airpods are a little like theyre open open in headphones so theyre not that bassy now these are ak these are by akg so obviously these sound better which they do but its not a noticeable difference that sounds better with the i dont its not that noticeable so i got these they broke instantly um they broke they were broken out of box and these were also broken out of box um but they i did get to use them for a little bit um so anyway lets talk about the size which is one downfall if i can get this box open hold on i hate apple boxes well i dont hate them i like them actually pretty creative but um extremely hard to open why is it so hard there we go no oh theres no insert in here but um theres no you know you youve always you obviously know what airpods the size of airpods are and these are definitely bigger um so thats why and you can tell um the packaging is a little um better on apples ends just wanted to mention that now you can see here this is where um the galaxy buds would have gone and you can see this um with a little extra room to spare doesnt fit so theyre quite a bit bigger than your average galaxy buds theyre even bigger than the raycons as i have checked the measurements so theyre pretty big headphones um thats probably going to do it for this review the headphones have held up really well the battery life and the headphones is advertised um seven hours of play i do believe it lasts about six nearly a full day with the minimum well with medium usage because i listen to music a lot and the microphone on these um its its not the best uh um these these little uh one of these five dollar warrant headphones um have a better microphone but these sound these are trash i just use these for extra i keep them around just in case i do end up somehow breaking these i gotta say this is the nokia 3310 equivalent of headphones because this the case i like the case its nice and bulky although there is a little extra room they could have used two minutes to lower the thing but the case is bigger for better battery so the battery is obviously better on the galaxy but its six hours so thats less than these um i do believe the charging case is um okay it does not say but i do believe the charging for that is five hours so thats an advantage with these anyway that was to review i hope you liked the review um i 100 recommend these if youre looking for headphones now theres a few other headphones that im going to be getting and looking into like a few off of amazon that are from brands that no ones ever that no ones really heard of im going to be buying a few wish headphones too to compare them to and i might even do a video soon about fake airpods which i guess will be fun which airport which fake airpods is closest to the real ones anyway thank you for watching follow my social medias they will both be linked down below or right there ill put it right there i dont know i

"video_id": "w8EruV90ego", "Closed Captions": " hey guys this is a quick unboxing review of the jabra gn evolve 2 85 so lets open up and take a look Music so pretty wicked that the only thing in the box is the case i like the minimalist and frustration free packaging so this ones integrated with microsoft teams or certified just like the logitech brio 4k camera certified for teams and the cool thing about these headphones is you know when someones on a call or they have a meeting and in teams or skype for business they have a little red dot beside their profile picture saying that theyre on a call or or whatnot these headphones will actually um glow red on the side um and you know saying that youre busy youre on a call and although thats really interesting im im not sure that your coworkers around you you know even in a post covet office situation will see that oh his uh headphones are red um hes on a call um you know im not sure how well that will work but it is just fantastic that this feature exists so you got this nice matte finish really nice puff on the headband part you have your salt pack to dry things out so usb c 31 they give you an aux cable two bands airplane adapter ill keep those in there i assume thats what its there for im not sure what else this would be there for other than to make you a pocket so huge case compared to the bose 35 uh quiet comfort mark twos uh this case is about 25 larger so you have these guys a lot of puff on there but actually its not as much puff as you think because if you press down here its really hard right here so right here is um thats not all puff that that is a half puff um so you got this pull here protects the buttons the buttons are pretty nice you get your toggle looks like an app so you can go from on or sorry off to bluetooth i assume pull this yeah so theyre bluetooth and they also give you um a wireless dongle adapter i believe but we shall see the microphone is kind of ingenious like you dont want to always have a dedicated mic but this will just come down like that and when youre not using the microphone you know it would be nice if it actually recessed properly in there because now it looks like oh your headphones are broken but um you compared to the other side what happened there oh nothing its just my microphone interesting that these pop in and out probably for some added comfort pretty nice extend i like how it doesnt make that clicking sound when you extend headphones like okay ill just try them on so really comfortable they fit really well and even without them being on good noise isolation cancellation well have to see the software level microphone level cancellation in a bit you have your aux port there bluetooth indicator usbc um not sure if thats a charger and uh i believe this to hear outside in when you turn on and off noise canceling or to sense what to cancel out so im going to try these out for the whole day on microsoft teams and im gonna report back so the few tests i did do was comparing bluetooth to your computer versus the usb dongle and i gotta say you have to use the usb dongle to take advantage of the the boom mic um for those that maybe miss this in the case its kind of hidden like its actually this thing is over it so if youre not looking for it you wont find it this is the usb um dongle so youre gonna get superior uh quality both on the microphone and on the um speak um the headphones on your computer obviously you cant do that on your phone you just bluetooth it and whatnot and um it does sound better when you um when you take down like its got mics in it so you dont have to use the boom mic but it does sound better when you use the boom mic and just make sure that you turn it this way so its in front of your mouth when youre talking the closer the better but compared to the ant lion mod mic wireless or mod mic 5 mod mic wireless and and um the wireless and the five are much better microphone quality and then for sound quality compared to the bose 35 um ii quiet comfort the sound on these is a slightly better but youre also spending about 150 dollars more the cool microsoft teams option here that will show red on the side of the headphones when youre in a a meeting or a call is nice however one issue with it is when youre in an office people dont really um you know oh hes got a red at the side of his head so i he i know hes in a call like i dont think that um social formality has been you know understood i dont think people would really pick up on that they just think like oh hes wearing some kind of wireless headset theres just a light glowing um but pretty cool that its team certified got the teams logo um i would say for someone that doesnt have the mod mic wireless um um then you know it could be a good option to pick these up but for me i just need that superior voice quality when im taking um work personal and professional meetings and this is almost there i would say its about 75 as good as mod wireless for the microphone a lot of people when theyre buying headphones are just looking for good sound quality because listening to music and whatnot but if you take meetings all day with the clients and coworkers you definitely want to sound the best so you want the best microphone so i would definitely rate mod mic um the highest and these probably number two so i hope you guys enjoyed this review and have a great day Music you", "video_title": "Best Headset Headphones for Microsoft Teams Jabra Evolve2 85 MS Wireless Headphones Link380a", "video_comment_count": "00",
